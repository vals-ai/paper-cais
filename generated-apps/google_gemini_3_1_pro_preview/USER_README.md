# Zeeter Social Network - User Manual

Welcome to Zeeter! A short-form publishing platform designed for easy interactions, sharing thoughts, and staying connected with your network.

## Navigation Guide to Test the Application

### Accessing the App
When the application is running, navigate to the URL provided by your deployment environment (e.g., `http://localhost:XXXXX`).

### Testing Authentication
You can create a brand new account by clicking the **"Get Started"** button on the landing page and signing up with a random email and an easy password (e.g., `password123`). Email verification has been bypassed for immediate testing.
Alternatively, the application is pre-seeded with active users you can log in as to test features instantly.

**Pre-Seeded Accounts:**
1. **User 1 (John)**
   - **Email:** `member1@example.com`
   - **Password:** `password123`
2. **User 2 (Jane)**
   - **Email:** `member2@example.com`
   - **Password:** `password123`
3. **User 3 (Bob)**
   - **Email:** `member3@example.com`
   - **Password:** `password123`

### Key Workflows to Explore

**1. Create a Post**
- Log in and arrive at the **Home** feed (`/`).
- At the top, write a message in the "What's happening?" input (max 280 characters).
- Click **"Post"** to publish. The feed will instantly update.

**2. Follow Users & Browse Feeds**
- Your Home page has two tabs: **Following** and **Global**.
- **Global:** Shows recent posts from the entire community.
- **Following:** Only shows posts from users you follow.
- **Following Action:** From the Global feed, tap on an author's name or avatar to view their full profile. If you don't follow them yet, click the "Follow" button.

**3. Interact with Content**
- Under each post, you can test the **Like (Heart)** button.
- Click the **Comment (Message Bubble)** button to expand the thread and reply to the post.

**4. View Notifications**
- Check the top navigation bar and click the **Bell icon** (`/notifications`).
- The pre-seeded accounts already contain notifications (John will see likes and comments from Jane).
- Try logging into one account, commenting on another account's post, and then logging into the second account to view the real-time notification generated.
