Your task is to build the application.\nIt is crucial your code works and follows the specification and deployment instructions given below. Focus hard when writing the code.\nYou CANNOT interact with the user at any point, you are on your own. Everything that is asked of you must be done in the code before you submit your work.\nYou CANNOT expect the user to perform any actions during or after the code is written.\nDO NOT stop working until you have a fully working application that you have tested.\nIT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU MAKE SURE TO TEST THE APPLICATION BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR WORK, INCLUDING MAKING SURE YOU BUILD AND START THE DOCKER COMPOSE APPLICATION. DO NOT SUBMIT APPLICATIONS THAT DO NOT RUN. ALWAYS ASSUME ANY ERRORS IN BUILDING OR TESTING THE APPLICATION ARE YOUR FAULT AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX.\n\n<TECH_STACK_GUIDELINES>\nTech stack guidelines:\nAlways use **React with Vite** as the framework for the frontend.\nDo not use Next.js or any other framework unless explicitly requested.\n\nProject scaffold guidelines:\n1. The target directory already exists (e.g., \"generated-app\"). Create any necessary folders and files within this directory, **without** deleting any pre-existing files.\n   - Example:\n       cd generated-app\n       yes | npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react\n   - **Do not overwrite `.env`** or any other files that the user has provided. .env is CRUCIAL for the development and testing of the application. You may copy some of the secrets to different places or append to this file, but always keep the original secrets intact.\n2. Keep the project **minimal and lightweight**.\n3. Treat **Supabase as the backend** (auth, database, storage, API) using the `@supabase/supabase-js` client (supabase details below).\n4. Organize frontend code in a flat folder structure under `frontend/src/`:\n    - `src/components/` \u2192 reusable UI components\n    - `src/pages/` \u2192 page components\n    - `src/hooks/` \u2192 custom React hooks\n    - `src/lib/` \u2192 helper functions (e.g., Supabase client)\n5. Use **React Router** for navigation if multiple pages are required.\n6. Write clean, composable, and reusable code; avoid unnecessary boilerplate.\n7. Follow Vite + React best practices:\n    - Always use **ES modules** (`import`/`export`)\n    - Lazy-load large components via `React.lazy` or dynamic imports\n    - Do not modify Vite's default config unless necessary\n8. Try to use Tailwind CSS v3. When scaffolding shadcn/ui, use `shadcn@2.3.0` for compatibility.\n\nBackend Services (use only when necessary) for specific API endpoints:\n  Use Express.js with Node.js for API endpoints that can't be handled by Supabase\n  Examples of when a backend service is needed:\n    Most likely: third-party API integrations that require server-side secrets: Stripe, etc.\n    Less likely: complex business logic that requires server-side processing, but only if it is truly necessary.\n\n  Keep REST API simple: use /api/[resource] structure\n  Always validate inputs and handle errors gracefully\n  Refer to the deployment setup for details on how to set it up and include it in the application\n  Remember: most functionality should be handled by Supabase - only create backend services for truly necessary cases\n</TECH_STACK_GUIDELINES>\n\n<UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\nUI/UX Design Guidelines:\n  You must create a modern, professional interface. Make sure your nice design is actually rendered in the application.\n  Follow these principles to create high-quality, professional interfaces:\n\n  Visual Design:\n    - Use consistent design system with unified color tokens, typography, spacing, and components\n    - Limit typography to 4-5 font sizes and weights for visual hierarchy\n    - Stick to 1 neutral base color (e.g., zinc) and up to 2 accent colors maximum\n    - Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm\n\n  Component Architecture:\n    - Build modular, reusable components to avoid duplication\n    - Factor repeated UI patterns into shared components\n    - Keep components small and focused, avoiding unnecessary complexity\n\n  User Experience:\n    - Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling for long content streams\n    - Implement skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` for loading states\n    - Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`)\n    - Provide clear visual feedback for user interactions and state changes\n    - Ensure responsive design that works across different screen sizes\n\nCRITICAL: The design system is everything. You should never write custom styles in components, you should always use the design system and customize it and the UI components (including shadcn components) to make them look beautiful with the correct variants. You never use classes like text-white, bg-white, etc. You always use the design system tokens.\n\n- Maximize reusability of components.\n- Leverage the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files to create a consistent design system that can be reused across the app instead of custom styles everywhere.\n- Create variants in the components you'll use. Shadcn components are made to be customized!\n- You review and customize the shadcn components to make them look beautiful with the correct variants.\n- CRITICAL: USE SEMANTIC TOKENS FOR COLORS, GRADIENTS, FONTS, ETC. It's important you follow best practices. DO NOT use direct colors like text-white, text-black, bg-white, bg-black, etc. Everything must be themed via the design system defined in the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files!\n- Always consider the design system when making changes.\n- Pay attention to contrast, color, and typography.\n- Always generate responsive designs.\n- Beautiful designs are your top priority, so make sure to edit the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files as often as necessary to avoid boring designs and leverage colors and animations.\n- Pay attention to dark vs light mode styles of components. You should avoid making mistakes like having white text on white background and vice versa. You should make sure to use the correct styles for each mode.\n</UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\n\n<SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\nSupabase Integration:\n  You must use Supabase for database, authentication, and storage.\n  The Supabase service is already running and configured. You SHOULD NOT reproduce any of the Supabase services locally.\n  Focus on using the MCP tools and the SDK to interact with the Supabase service as described below. You cannot use the default CLI as if you were accessing Supabase Cloud.\n  The keys and URLs you will need are in the .env file: `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.\n\n  Database:\n    - Use the MCP tools for all database operations (you have access to a self-hosted Supabase database)\n    - The only way to interact with the database is through the MCP tools available to you\n    - Do not create separate database services in Docker\n    - When calling MCP SQL tools, pass statements via the `query` argument (both `execute_sql` and `apply_migration` expect it)\n    - Respect Row Level Security (RLS) and database constraints. Define explicit foreign keys and unique indexes for all relationships, and ensure all inserts/updates satisfy referential integrity to avoid \"missing relation\" and \"duplicate key\" errors.\n    - Capture schema changes as real migrations: prefer the `apply_migration` tool so Supabase records the version, and check the generated SQL into `supabase/migrations/`. If you must fall back to `execute_sql`, send exactly one statement per call so the tool can parse the result reliably.\n    - For admin/seed operations that require bypassing RLS, use the service role key; for user-facing flows, use the anon key and create appropriate RLS policies. Never disable RLS.\n    - Apply schema migrations and policies via the MCP SQL tools before running the app.\n\n  Seeding & Test Data:\n    - Provide a minimal seed routine that creates the records required by the spec and tests (e.g., at least one event and organizer with valid relations).\n    - Make seeding idempotent: upsert by natural keys to avoid duplicate key violations.\n    - Document how to run the seed and run it before UI testing.\n\n  Authentication & Storage:\n    - Use Supabase SDK for authentication and file storage\n    - Use MCP tools for server-side database operations and setup.\n    - The Studio MCP server does not expose auth-user helpers. For seeding or admin automation, call Supabase Auth directly using the service role key\u2014either via `supabase.auth.admin.*` in the SDK or by POSTing to `/auth/v1/admin/users` through Kong. Document any seeded credentials in the README.\n    - Implement proper auth flows (login, signup, logout, protected routes), if it is required by the spec.\n    - Handle authentication state management properly\n    - For the authentication, the email verification is disabled, as well as the third-party authentication like Google, Apple, etc. Do not try to use them.\n    - If there is an authentication flow, strongly test it, as it is the entry point of the application and if it doesn't work, the application won't work.\n    - The anonymous authentication is disabled. Your app should not handle anonymous users and require signed up users.\n    - Use Supabase storage for file uploads when needed\n\n  Additional Services:\n    - You only can use Supabase authentication, database, and storage.\n    - You DO NOT have access to edge functions, neither with MCP nor directly with SDK/CLI.\n    - Any other services you may need must be written in the backend service, only if it is crucial.\n\n  Configuration:\n    - DO NOT hardcode any API keys, secrets, or URLs in the docker-compose.yml file\n    - All sensitive configuration must be in a .env file. The .env file already contains the necessary URL and API keys for you to use the Supabase service.\n    - Reference Supabase documentation if needed: https://supabase.com/docs and https://supabase.com/docs/reference.\n    - Keep in mind the user will not be able to access the Supabase service once you have submitted the app.\n</SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely No Mocks or Stubs (Hard Requirement):\n  - Do not mock payments or return hardcoded success for checkout/subscription flows. A real Stripe test-mode call must occur.\n  - Do not mock email sending; use SMTP with the env values and send test emails (MailHog will capture them in dev).\n  - Avoid in-memory replacements for required services when the spec calls for them (e.g., do not replace Supabase/Stripe with in-memory data for subscriptions or billing flows).\n  - Submissions that include phrases like \"mock Stripe\", \"fake payment\", or bypass external calls will be rejected.\n\n\n<DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n# Deployment Instructions\nDocker and Docker Compose are already installed in the environment. Do not try to install them or change the installed versions.\nThe Docker daemon should also be running in the background. Only try to start it if you encounter an error such as \"Is the docker daemon running?\".\nWhen you start the app, it should be available at the APP_PUBLIC_URL and APP_PUBLIC_PORT, using localhost.\nThe different services (like Supabase) you have access to are using a different host, because they are running in a different place than your development environment. Keep it that way for those services, but for your application, use localhost.\nInside the frontend, you should not hardcode any backend or Supabase URLs you query; instead, you should append them as variables to a .env file.\n\nYou are asked to make the application runnable with Docker Compose.\nIt must be runnable from the generated-app directory, i.e., {workspace_path}/generated-app/ in your case.\nThe project structure should be:\n\n```\n{workspace_path}/\n  .browser_screenshots/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  .downloads/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  generated-app/\n    .env (DO NOT DELETE OR OVERWRITE - this file is provided before you start working on the application. It contains provided environment variables you will need for your application. Do not overwrite it. You may need to copy the values to other .env file).\n    docker-compose.yml\n    frontend/\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.frontend # Dockerfile for the frontend\n      src/ # folder created by the Vite CLI, containing the frontend code\n      ...other folders/files...\n    backend/ # Only create a backend if necessary\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.backend\n    ...other folders/files...\n```\n\nThe backend folder is optional - you only need to create it if necessary.\n\nIf you use CLI tools to initialize the app, never use options that can delete existing files you are provided with, especially the .env file.\nThis .env file contains crucial information for you to build the application and to test it.\n\n## Docker Compose Setup\n- Create a single `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root ({workspace_path}/generated-app/)\n- Name the frontend service exactly `zeeter` (this service will be exposed)\n- Do NOT use `networks` configuration - only fill in the `services` section\n- Do NOT use `container_name` fields\n- Remember that at application test time, there will be no cached Docker images, so you must make sure the build command works.\n- Always run the container by building and then previewing it (e.g. `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`, `npm run serve`, or `npm start`); avoid `npm run dev`.\n- In case you need to save data outside of what Supabase already provides, DO NOT rely on Docker Compose creating persistent volumes for your app's data, because in the testing environment those volumes might not be preserved. Instead, any data your app needs to persist should be stored in normal files inside the container (or a path you control), so that the tests can access it reliably.\n- Keep the docker-compose.yml and the Dockerfiles minimal, as simple as possible.\n- This doesn't need to be production-ready; it just needs to run in development/preview mode. A simple Dockerfile is enough\u2014no need for a multi-stage or optimized production setup.\n- DO NOT use the network_mode field in the docker-compose.yml file.\n\n## Port Configuration\n- The app landing page URL is defined by `APP_PUBLIC_URL` in the `.env`; treat it as the source of truth and never assume `http://localhost:4173`.\n- Always map the host port from `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` to the frontend preview port `4173` in Docker Compose (for example, `ports: - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"`).\n- Do not override `APP_PUBLIC_URL` or `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` inside your code; surface them through environment variables so both frontend and backend use the same public origin.\n- Always import the port from the .env file, never hardcode it in the application code anywhere.\n- Configure Vite to listen on all interfaces for both dev and preview (set `server.host`/`preview.host` to `0.0.0.0` or pass `--host 0.0.0.0`).\n- If you add backend services that are internal-only, prefer `expose: - 8000` instead of publishing them to the host.\n\n## Example of minimal docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile (they might need to be more complex depending on the project). These match all the requirements described above. You might need them to be more complicated depending on the project (especially if you need backend services), but always strive to keep it simple:\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\nEXPOSE 4173\nCMD [\"npm\", \"run\", \"preview\"]\n```\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  donation_manager:\n    build:\n      context: ./frontend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend\n    ports:\n      - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"  # APP_PUBLIC_PORT should always be imported from the .env file\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n\n  backend: # Only use a backend service if necessary\n    build:\n      context: ./backend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n    expose: # NEVER use ports: - 8000:8000 kind of configuration here, as it would publish the backend port outside of the Docker Compose network\n      - 8000\n```\n\nExample of a minimal backend Dockerfile (if necessary):\n```\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\n# Copy only what the backend needs, not the entire frontend\nEXPOSE 8000\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n```\n\n## Docker Ignore\nAlways include a `.dockerignore` file in any relevant folder (e.g. frontend/, backend/, etc.) to avoid copying unnecessary files into the container image.\nAt minimum, ignore build outputs and dependency folders such as: node_modules, dist, build, etc.\nExample of a `.dockerignore` file:\n```\nnode_modules\n.next\ndist\n.git\n```\n\n## Development & Testing Workflow\n1. **Initial build (and try before submitting)**: `docker compose -p zeeter up -d --build`\n2. **After code changes**: `docker compose -p zeeter restart <service>`\n3. **Only rebuild when**: dependencies or docker-compose.yml change\n4. **Check the logs to make sure the application is running correctly**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter logs --tail 200` (or wrap `logs -f` in a short `timeout`) so the command exits on its own.\n5. **Test the app through the UI**: You must browse the running application and take screenshots (you MUST save them in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`) to verify functionality\n6. **Before submitting**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter down -v`\n7. **Report**: Report how the testing went in your final thoughts before submitting your work. Mention what worked or didn't work ,and if you were using the expected workflow. Report precisely the errors or issues you have encountered in the deployment, if any.\n\n## Mandatory Testing\n- Browse the running application and take screenshots to verify functionality\n- Fix issues and restart services until you've verified everything works\n- Save all screenshots in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`\n\nThe application must be fully functional when run with the following command from {workspace_path}/generated-app/:\n```bash\ndocker compose -p zeeter up -d --build\n```\n</DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n\n<README_INSTRUCTIONS>\nREADME instructions:\n  You must create two READMEs for the application:\n  First, a technical TECHNICAL_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. General Implementation\n      - App overview and key features\n      - Tech stack summary\n      - Architecture approach\n  2. Code Structure\n      - Frontend/backend directory layout\n      - Key files and their purposes\n      - Database schema\n\n  Second, a user-friendly USER_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. Navigation Guide to Test the Application\n      - Authentication (admin or not) method if any\n      - Key URLs and actions\n      - If there is an authentication flow, provide default credentials to be able to test the application without recreating an account.\n\n  Note: Exclude startup instructions - app runs via Docker commands in deployment docs\n</README_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n<GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\nGeneral Instructions and Advice:\n  - The folder you are working in is `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace`. You cannot write outside of this folder. It also may contain the following files and folders, that you CANNOT delete in any circumstance (it would break the application):\n  ```\n  /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/\n    .browser_screenshots/\n    .downloads/\n    generated-app/\n  ```\n  - You must create your application in `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/generated-app/` directory. This is where your docker-compose.yml, .env file, and all application code should be placed.\n  - The .browser_screenshots/ and .downloads/ folders at the `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace` level must NEVER be deleted or moved - they are used for testing purposes.\n  - If you have trouble loading data in the application, make sure to `docker compose -p zeeter down -v` before running `docker compose -p zeeter up -d` again. It will clear the volumes and start fresh.\n  - Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for all operations.\n  - Strictly restrict yourself to the services you have access to. Do not try to implement services that are not available to you. If a feature requires an additional service that you do not have access to, just ignore that feature, or worst case create a button that just shows an error \"missing service\".\n  - If you encounter issues with the infrastructure you are running in, make sure to put them in your final thoughts before submitting your work. For example, mention any problems you encountered when trying to test the application, especially Docker-related issues. Make sure to report the commands that failed with the error message.\n  - You must focus on doing the full task. Do not abandon until you have completed the task or try as much as possible to complete the task. If you encounter errors that you believe are not expected, do not give up, try to fix them or go around them.\n  - You are on your own, you CANNOT interact with the user at any point. Do not expect them to take any actions after the code is written. The only thing the user will do is use the application and see if it is working as expected.\n  - Before running any UI tests, run the project's seed routine to ensure required data exists and relationships are valid (avoid RLS and constraint errors during evaluation).\n</GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\n\n<TASK_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\nSpecification for the application.

Make sure your nice design is actually rendered in the application.\n  Follow these principles to create high-quality, professional interfaces:\n\n  Visual Design:\n    - Use consistent design system with unified color tokens, typography, spacing, and components\n    - Limit typography to 4-5 font sizes and weights for visual hierarchy\n    - Stick to 1 neutral base color (e.g., zinc) and up to 2 accent colors maximum\n    - Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm\n\n  Component Architecture:\n    - Build modular, reusable components to avoid duplication\n    - Factor repeated UI patterns into shared components\n    - Keep components small and focused, avoiding unnecessary complexity\n\n  User Experience:\n    - Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling for long content streams\n    - Implement skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` for loading states\n    - Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`)\n    - Provide clear visual feedback for user interactions and state changes\n    - Ensure responsive design that works across different screen sizes\n\nCRITICAL: The design system is everything. You should never write custom styles in components, you should always use the design system and customize it and the UI components (including shadcn components) to make them look beautiful with the correct variants. You never use classes like text-white, bg-white, etc. You always use the design system tokens.\n\n- Maximize reusability of components.\n- Leverage the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files to create a consistent design system that can be reused across the app instead of custom styles everywhere.\n- Create variants in the components you'll use. Shadcn components are made to be customized!\n- You review and customize the shadcn components to make them look beautiful with the correct variants.\n- CRITICAL: USE SEMANTIC TOKENS FOR COLORS, GRADIENTS, FONTS, ETC. It's important you follow best practices. DO NOT use direct colors like text-white, text-black, bg-white, bg-black, etc. Everything must be themed via the design system defined in the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files!\n- Always consider the design system when making changes.\n- Pay attention to contrast, color, and typography.\n- Always generate responsive designs.\n- Beautiful designs are your top priority, so make sure to edit the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files as often as necessary to avoid boring designs and leverage colors and animations.\n- Pay attention to dark vs light mode styles of components. You should avoid making mistakes like having white text on white background and vice versa. You should make sure to use the correct styles for each mode.\n</UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\n\n<SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\nSupabase Integration:\n  You must use Supabase for database, authentication, and storage.\n  The Supabase service is already running and configured. You SHOULD NOT reproduce any of the Supabase services locally.\n  Focus on using the MCP tools and the SDK to interact with the Supabase service as described below. You cannot use the default CLI as if you were accessing Supabase Cloud.\n  The keys and URLs you will need are in the .env file: `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.\n\n  Database:\n    - Use the MCP tools for all database operations (you have access to a self-hosted Supabase database)\n    - The only way to interact with the database is through the MCP tools available to you\n    - Do not create separate database services in Docker\n    - When calling MCP SQL tools, pass statements via the `query` argument (both `execute_sql` and `apply_migration` expect it)\n    - Respect Row Level Security (RLS) and database constraints. Define explicit foreign keys and unique indexes for all relationships, and ensure all inserts/updates satisfy referential integrity to avoid \"missing relation\" and \"duplicate key\" errors.\n    - Capture schema changes as real migrations: prefer the `apply_migration` tool so Supabase records the version, and check the generated SQL into `supabase/migrations/`. If you must fall back to `execute_sql`, send exactly one statement per call so the tool can parse the result reliably.\n    - For admin/seed operations that require bypassing RLS, use the service role key; for user-facing flows, use the anon key and create appropriate RLS policies. Never disable RLS.\n    - Apply schema migrations and policies via the MCP SQL tools before running the app.\n\n  Seeding & Test Data:\n    - Provide a minimal seed routine that creates the records required by the spec and tests (e.g., at least one event and organizer with valid relations).\n    - Make seeding idempotent: upsert by natural keys to avoid duplicate key violations.\n    - Document how to run the seed and run it before UI testing.\n\n  Authentication & Storage:\n    - Use Supabase SDK for authentication and file storage\n    - Use MCP tools for server-side database operations and setup.\n    - The Studio MCP server does not expose auth-user helpers. For seeding or admin automation, call Supabase Auth directly using the service role key\u2014either via `supabase.auth.admin.*` in the SDK or by POSTing to `/auth/v1/admin/users` through Kong. Document any seeded credentials in the README.\n    - Implement proper auth flows (login, signup, logout, protected routes), if it is required by the spec.\n    - Handle authentication state management properly\n    - For the authentication, the email verification is disabled, as well as the third-party authentication like Google, Apple, etc. Do not try to use them.\n    - If there is an authentication flow, strongly test it, as it is the entry point of the application and if it doesn't work, the application won't work.\n    - The anonymous authentication is disabled. Your app should not handle anonymous users and require signed up users.\n    - Use Supabase storage for file uploads when needed\n\n  Additional Services:\n    - You only can use Supabase authentication, database, and storage.\n    - You DO NOT have access to edge functions, neither with MCP nor directly with SDK/CLI.\n    - Any other services you may need must be written in the backend service, only if it is crucial.\n\n  Configuration:\n    - DO NOT hardcode any API keys, secrets, or URLs in the docker-compose.yml file\n    - All sensitive configuration must be in a .env file. The .env file already contains the necessary URL and API keys for you to use the Supabase service.\n    - Reference Supabase documentation if needed: https://supabase.com/docs and https://supabase.com/docs/reference.\n    - Keep in mind the user will not be able to access the Supabase service once you have submitted the app.\n</SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely No Mocks or Stubs (Hard Requirement):\n  - Do not mock payments or return hardcoded success for checkout/subscription flows. A real Stripe test-mode call must occur.\n  - Do not mock email sending; use SMTP with the env values and send test emails (MailHog will capture them in dev).\n  - Avoid in-memory replacements for required services when the spec calls for them (e.g., do not replace Supabase/Stripe with in-memory data for subscriptions or billing flows).\n  - Submissions that include phrases like \"mock Stripe\", \"fake payment\", or bypass external calls will be rejected.\n\n\n<DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n# Deployment Instructions\nDocker and Docker Compose are already installed in the environment. Do not try to install them or change the installed versions.\nThe Docker daemon should also be running in the background. Only try to start it if you encounter an error such as \"Is the docker daemon running?\".\nWhen you start the app, it should be available at the APP_PUBLIC_URL and APP_PUBLIC_PORT, using localhost.\nThe different services (like Supabase) you have access to are using a different host, because they are running in a different place than your development environment. Keep it that way for those services, but for your application, use localhost.\nInside the frontend, you should not hardcode any backend or Supabase URLs you query; instead, you should append them as variables to a .env file.\n\nYou are asked to make the application runnable with Docker Compose.\nIt must be runnable from the generated-app directory, i.e., {workspace_path}/generated-app/ in your case.\nThe project structure should be:\n\n```\n{workspace_path}/\n  .browser_screenshots/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  .downloads/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  generated-app/\n    .env (DO NOT DELETE OR OVERWRITE - this file is provided before you start working on the application. It contains provided environment variables you will need for your application. Do not overwrite it. You may need to copy the values to other .env file).\n    docker-compose.yml\n    frontend/\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.frontend # Dockerfile for the frontend\n      src/ # folder created by the Vite CLI, containing the frontend code\n      ...other folders/files...\n    backend/ # Only create a backend if necessary\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.backend\n    ...other folders/files...\n```\n\nThe backend folder is optional - you only need to create it if necessary.\n\nIf you use CLI tools to initialize the app, never use options that can delete existing files you are provided with, especially the .env file.\nThis .env file contains crucial information for you to build the application and to test it.\n\n## Docker Compose Setup\n- Create a single `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root ({workspace_path}/generated-app/)\n- Name the frontend service exactly `zeeter` (this service will be exposed)\n- Do NOT use `networks` configuration - only fill in the `services` section\n- Do NOT use `container_name` fields\n- Remember that at application test time, there will be no cached Docker images, so you must make sure the build command works.\n- Always run the container by building and then previewing it (e.g. `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`, `npm run serve`, or `npm start`); avoid `npm run dev`.\n- In case you need to save data outside of what Supabase already provides, DO NOT rely on Docker Compose creating persistent volumes for your app's data, because in the testing environment those volumes might not be preserved. Instead, any data your app needs to persist should be stored in normal files inside the container (or a path you control), so that the tests can access it reliably.\n- Keep the docker-compose.yml and the Dockerfiles minimal, as simple as possible.\n- This doesn't need to be production-ready; it just needs to run in development/preview mode. A simple Dockerfile is enough\u2014no need for a multi-stage or optimized production setup.\n- DO NOT use the network_mode field in the docker-compose.yml file.\n\n## Port Configuration\n- The app landing page URL is defined by `APP_PUBLIC_URL` in the `.env`; treat it as the source of truth and never assume `http://localhost:4173`.\n- Always map the host port from `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` to the frontend preview port `4173` in Docker Compose (for example, `ports: - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"`).\n- Do not override `APP_PUBLIC_URL` or `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` inside your code; surface them through environment variables so both frontend and backend use the same public origin.\n- Always import the port from the .env file, never hardcode it in the application code anywhere.\n- Configure Vite to listen on all interfaces for both dev and preview (set `server.host`/`preview.host` to `0.0.0.0` or pass `--host 0.0.0.0`).\n- If you add backend services that are internal-only, prefer `expose: - 8000` instead of publishing them to the host.\n\n## Example of minimal docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile (they might need to be more complex depending on the project). These match all the requirements described above. You might need them to be more complicated depending on the project (especially if you need backend services), but always strive to keep it simple:\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\nEXPOSE 4173\nCMD [\"npm\", \"run\", \"preview\"]\n```\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  donation_manager:\n    build:\n      context: ./frontend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend\n    ports:\n      - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"  # APP_PUBLIC_PORT should always be imported from the .env file\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n\n  backend: # Only use a backend service if necessary\n    build:\n      context: ./backend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n    expose: # NEVER use ports: - 8000:8000 kind of configuration here, as it would publish the backend port outside of the Docker Compose network\n      - 8000\n```\n\nExample of a minimal backend Dockerfile (if necessary):\n```\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\n# Copy only what the backend needs, not the entire frontend\nEXPOSE 8000\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n```\n\n## Docker Ignore\nAlways include a `.dockerignore` file in any relevant folder (e.g. frontend/, backend/, etc.) to avoid copying unnecessary files into the container image.\nAt minimum, ignore build outputs and dependency folders such as: node_modules, dist, build, etc.\nExample of a `.dockerignore` file:\n```\nnode_modules\n.next\ndist\n.git\n```\n\n## Development & Testing Workflow\n1. **Initial build (and try before submitting)**: `docker compose -p zeeter up -d --build`\n2. **After code changes**: `docker compose -p zeeter restart <service>`\n3. **Only rebuild when**: dependencies or docker-compose.yml change\n4. **Check the logs to make sure the application is running correctly**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter logs --tail 200` (or wrap `logs -f` in a short `timeout`) so the command exits on its own.\n5. **Test the app through the UI**: You must browse the running application and take screenshots (you MUST save them in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`) to verify functionality\n6. **Before submitting**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter down -v`\n7. **Report**: Report how the testing went in your final thoughts before submitting your work. Mention what worked or didn't work ,and if you were using the expected workflow. Report precisely the errors or issues you have encountered in the deployment, if any.\n\n## Mandatory Testing\n- Browse the running application and take screenshots to verify functionality\n- Fix issues and restart services until you've verified everything works\n- Save all screenshots in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`\n\nThe application must be fully functional when run with the following command from {workspace_path}/generated-app/:\n```bash\ndocker compose -p zeeter up -d --build\n```\n</DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n\n<README_INSTRUCTIONS>\nREADME instructions:\n  You must create two READMEs for the application:\n  First, a technical TECHNICAL_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. General Implementation\n      - App overview and key features\n      - Tech stack summary\n      - Architecture approach\n  2. Code Structure\n      - Frontend/backend directory layout\n      - Key files and their purposes\n      - Database schema\n\n  Second, a user-friendly USER_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. Navigation Guide to Test the Application\n      - Authentication (admin or not) method if any\n      - Key URLs and actions\n      - If there is an authentication flow, provide default credentials to be able to test the application without recreating an account.\n\n  Note: Exclude startup instructions - app runs via Docker commands in deployment docs\n</README_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n<GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\nGeneral Instructions and Advice:\n  - The folder you are working in is `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace`. You cannot write outside of this folder. It also may contain the following files and folders, that you CANNOT delete in any circumstance (it would break the application):\n  ```\n  /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/\n    .browser_screenshots/\n    .downloads/\n    generated-app/\n  ```\n  - You must create your application in `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/generated-app/` directory. This is where your docker-compose.yml, .env file, and all application code should be placed.\n  - The .browser_screenshots/ and .downloads/ folders at the `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace` level must NEVER be deleted or moved - they are used for testing purposes.\n  - If you have trouble loading data in the application, make sure to `docker compose -p zeeter down -v` before running `docker compose -p zeeter up -d` again. It will clear the volumes and start fresh.\n  - Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for all operations.\n  - Strictly restrict yourself to the services you have access to. Do not try to implement services that are not available to you. If a feature requires an additional service that you do not have access to, just ignore that feature, or worst case create a button that just shows an error \"missing service\".\n  - If you encounter issues with the infrastructure you are running in, make sure to put them in your final thoughts before submitting your work. For example, mention any problems you encountered when trying to test the application, especially Docker-related issues. Make sure to report the commands that failed with the error message.\n  - You must focus on doing the full task. Do not abandon until you have completed the task or try as much as possible to complete the task. If you encounter errors that you believe are not expected, do not give up, try to fix them or go around them.\n  - You are on your own, you CANNOT interact with the user at any point. Do not expect them to take any actions after the code is written. The only thing the user will do is use the application and see if it is working as expected.\n  - Before running any UI tests, run the project's seed routine to ensure required data exists and relationships are valid (avoid RLS and constraint errors during evaluation).\n</GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\n\n<TASK_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\nSpecification for the application.

ALWAYS ASSUME ANY ERRORS IN BUILDING OR TESTING THE APPLICATION ARE YOUR FAULT AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX.\n\n<TECH_STACK_GUIDELINES>\nTech stack guidelines:\nAlways use **React with Vite** as the framework for the frontend.\nDo not use Next.js or any other framework unless explicitly requested.\n\nProject scaffold guidelines:\n1. The target directory already exists (e.g., \"generated-app\"). Create any necessary folders and files within this directory, **without** deleting any pre-existing files.\n   - Example:\n       cd generated-app\n       yes | npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react\n   - **Do not overwrite `.env`** or any other files that the user has provided. .env is CRUCIAL for the development and testing of the application. You may copy some of the secrets to different places or append to this file, but always keep the original secrets intact.\n2. Keep the project **minimal and lightweight**.\n3. Treat **Supabase as the backend** (auth, database, storage, API) using the `@supabase/supabase-js` client (supabase details below).\n4. Organize frontend code in a flat folder structure under `frontend/src/`:\n    - `src/components/` \u2192 reusable UI components\n    - `src/pages/` \u2192 page components\n    - `src/hooks/` \u2192 custom React hooks\n    - `src/lib/` \u2192 helper functions (e.g., Supabase client)\n5. Use **React Router** for navigation if multiple pages are required.\n6. Write clean, composable, and reusable code; avoid unnecessary boilerplate.\n7. Follow Vite + React best practices:\n    - Always use **ES modules** (`import`/`export`)\n    - Lazy-load large components via `React.lazy` or dynamic imports\n    - Do not modify Vite's default config unless necessary\n8. Try to use Tailwind CSS v3. When scaffolding shadcn/ui, use `shadcn@2.3.0` for compatibility.\n\nBackend Services (use only when necessary) for specific API endpoints:\n  Use Express.js with Node.js for API endpoints that can't be handled by Supabase\n  Examples of when a backend service is needed:\n    Most likely: third-party API integrations that require server-side secrets: Stripe, etc.\n    Less likely: complex business logic that requires server-side processing, but only if it is truly necessary.\n\n  Keep REST API simple: use /api/[resource] structure\n  Always validate inputs and handle errors gracefully\n  Refer to the deployment setup for details on how to set it up and include it in the application\n  Remember: most functionality should be handled by Supabase - only create backend services for truly necessary cases\n</TECH_STACK_GUIDELINES>\n\n<UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\nUI/UX Design Guidelines:\n  You must create a modern, professional interface.

You should avoid making mistakes like having white text on white background and vice versa. You should make sure to use the correct styles for each mode.\n</UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\n\n<SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\nSupabase Integration:\n  You must use Supabase for database, authentication, and storage.\n  The Supabase service is already running and configured. You SHOULD NOT reproduce any of the Supabase services locally.\n  Focus on using the MCP tools and the SDK to interact with the Supabase service as described below. You cannot use the default CLI as if you were accessing Supabase Cloud.\n  The keys and URLs you will need are in the .env file: `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.\n\n  Database:\n    - Use the MCP tools for all database operations (you have access to a self-hosted Supabase database)\n    - The only way to interact with the database is through the MCP tools available to you\n    - Do not create separate database services in Docker\n    - When calling MCP SQL tools, pass statements via the `query` argument (both `execute_sql` and `apply_migration` expect it)\n    - Respect Row Level Security (RLS) and database constraints. Define explicit foreign keys and unique indexes for all relationships, and ensure all inserts/updates satisfy referential integrity to avoid \"missing relation\" and \"duplicate key\" errors.\n    - Capture schema changes as real migrations: prefer the `apply_migration` tool so Supabase records the version, and check the generated SQL into `supabase/migrations/`. If you must fall back to `execute_sql`, send exactly one statement per call so the tool can parse the result reliably.\n    - For admin/seed operations that require bypassing RLS, use the service role key; for user-facing flows, use the anon key and create appropriate RLS policies. Never disable RLS.\n    - Apply schema migrations and policies via the MCP SQL tools before running the app.\n\n  Seeding & Test Data:\n    - Provide a minimal seed routine that creates the records required by the spec and tests (e.g., at least one event and organizer with valid relations).\n    - Make seeding idempotent: upsert by natural keys to avoid duplicate key violations.\n    - Document how to run the seed and run it before UI testing.\n\n  Authentication & Storage:\n    - Use Supabase SDK for authentication and file storage\n    - Use MCP tools for server-side database operations and setup.\n    - The Studio MCP server does not expose auth-user helpers. For seeding or admin automation, call Supabase Auth directly using the service role key\u2014either via `supabase.auth.admin.*` in the SDK or by POSTing to `/auth/v1/admin/users` through Kong. Document any seeded credentials in the README.\n    - Implement proper auth flows (login, signup, logout, protected routes), if it is required by the spec.\n    - Handle authentication state management properly\n    - For the authentication, the email verification is disabled, as well as the third-party authentication like Google, Apple, etc. Do not try to use them.\n    - If there is an authentication flow, strongly test it, as it is the entry point of the application and if it doesn't work, the application won't work.\n    - The anonymous authentication is disabled. Your app should not handle anonymous users and require signed up users.\n    - Use Supabase storage for file uploads when needed\n\n  Additional Services:\n    - You only can use Supabase authentication, database, and storage.\n    - You DO NOT have access to edge functions, neither with MCP nor directly with SDK/CLI.\n    - Any other services you may need must be written in the backend service, only if it is crucial.\n\n  Configuration:\n    - DO NOT hardcode any API keys, secrets, or URLs in the docker-compose.yml file\n    - All sensitive configuration must be in a .env file. The .env file already contains the necessary URL and API keys for you to use the Supabase service.\n    - Reference Supabase documentation if needed: https://supabase.com/docs and https://supabase.com/docs/reference.\n    - Keep in mind the user will not be able to access the Supabase service once you have submitted the app.\n</SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely No Mocks or Stubs (Hard Requirement):\n  - Do not mock payments or return hardcoded success for checkout/subscription flows. A real Stripe test-mode call must occur.\n  - Do not mock email sending; use SMTP with the env values and send test emails (MailHog will capture them in dev).\n  - Avoid in-memory replacements for required services when the spec calls for them (e.g., do not replace Supabase/Stripe with in-memory data for subscriptions or billing flows).\n  - Submissions that include phrases like \"mock Stripe\", \"fake payment\", or bypass external calls will be rejected.\n\n\n<DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n# Deployment Instructions\nDocker and Docker Compose are already installed in the environment. Do not try to install them or change the installed versions.\nThe Docker daemon should also be running in the background. Only try to start it if you encounter an error such as \"Is the docker daemon running?\".\nWhen you start the app, it should be available at the APP_PUBLIC_URL and APP_PUBLIC_PORT, using localhost.\nThe different services (like Supabase) you have access to are using a different host, because they are running in a different place than your development environment. Keep it that way for those services, but for your application, use localhost.\nInside the frontend, you should not hardcode any backend or Supabase URLs you query; instead, you should append them as variables to a .env file.\n\nYou are asked to make the application runnable with Docker Compose.\nIt must be runnable from the generated-app directory, i.e., {workspace_path}/generated-app/ in your case.\nThe project structure should be:\n\n```\n{workspace_path}/\n  .browser_screenshots/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  .downloads/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  generated-app/\n    .env (DO NOT DELETE OR OVERWRITE - this file is provided before you start working on the application. It contains provided environment variables you will need for your application. Do not overwrite it. You may need to copy the values to other .env file).\n    docker-compose.yml\n    frontend/\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.frontend # Dockerfile for the frontend\n      src/ # folder created by the Vite CLI, containing the frontend code\n      ...other folders/files...\n    backend/ # Only create a backend if necessary\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.backend\n    ...other folders/files...\n```\n\nThe backend folder is optional - you only need to create it if necessary.\n\nIf you use CLI tools to initialize the app, never use options that can delete existing files you are provided with, especially the .env file.\nThis .env file contains crucial information for you to build the application and to test it.\n\n## Docker Compose Setup\n- Create a single `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root ({workspace_path}/generated-app/)\n- Name the frontend service exactly `zeeter` (this service will be exposed)\n- Do NOT use `networks` configuration - only fill in the `services` section\n- Do NOT use `container_name` fields\n- Remember that at application test time, there will be no cached Docker images, so you must make sure the build command works.\n- Always run the container by building and then previewing it (e.g. `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`, `npm run serve`, or `npm start`); avoid `npm run dev`.\n- In case you need to save data outside of what Supabase already provides, DO NOT rely on Docker Compose creating persistent volumes for your app's data, because in the testing environment those volumes might not be preserved. Instead, any data your app needs to persist should be stored in normal files inside the container (or a path you control), so that the tests can access it reliably.\n- Keep the docker-compose.yml and the Dockerfiles minimal, as simple as possible.\n- This doesn't need to be production-ready; it just needs to run in development/preview mode. A simple Dockerfile is enough\u2014no need for a multi-stage or optimized production setup.\n- DO NOT use the network_mode field in the docker-compose.yml file.\n\n## Port Configuration\n- The app landing page URL is defined by `APP_PUBLIC_URL` in the `.env`; treat it as the source of truth and never assume `http://localhost:4173`.\n- Always map the host port from `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` to the frontend preview port `4173` in Docker Compose (for example, `ports: - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"`).\n- Do not override `APP_PUBLIC_URL` or `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` inside your code; surface them through environment variables so both frontend and backend use the same public origin.\n- Always import the port from the .env file, never hardcode it in the application code anywhere.\n- Configure Vite to listen on all interfaces for both dev and preview (set `server.host`/`preview.host` to `0.0.0.0` or pass `--host 0.0.0.0`).\n- If you add backend services that are internal-only, prefer `expose: - 8000` instead of publishing them to the host.\n\n## Example of minimal docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile (they might need to be more complex depending on the project). These match all the requirements described above. You might need them to be more complicated depending on the project (especially if you need backend services), but always strive to keep it simple:\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\nEXPOSE 4173\nCMD [\"npm\", \"run\", \"preview\"]\n```\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  donation_manager:\n    build:\n      context: ./frontend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend\n    ports:\n      - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"  # APP_PUBLIC_PORT should always be imported from the .env file\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n\n  backend: # Only use a backend service if necessary\n    build:\n      context: ./backend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n    expose: # NEVER use ports: - 8000:8000 kind of configuration here, as it would publish the backend port outside of the Docker Compose network\n      - 8000\n```\n\nExample of a minimal backend Dockerfile (if necessary):\n```\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\n# Copy only what the backend needs, not the entire frontend\nEXPOSE 8000\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n```\n\n## Docker Ignore\nAlways include a `.dockerignore` file in any relevant folder (e.g. frontend/, backend/, etc.) to avoid copying unnecessary files into the container image.\nAt minimum, ignore build outputs and dependency folders such as: node_modules, dist, build, etc.\nExample of a `.dockerignore` file:\n```\nnode_modules\n.next\ndist\n.git\n```\n\n## Development & Testing Workflow\n1. **Initial build (and try before submitting)**: `docker compose -p zeeter up -d --build`\n2. **After code changes**: `docker compose -p zeeter restart <service>`\n3. **Only rebuild when**: dependencies or docker-compose.yml change\n4. **Check the logs to make sure the application is running correctly**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter logs --tail 200` (or wrap `logs -f` in a short `timeout`) so the command exits on its own.\n5. **Test the app through the UI**: You must browse the running application and take screenshots (you MUST save them in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`) to verify functionality\n6. **Before submitting**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter down -v`\n7. **Report**: Report how the testing went in your final thoughts before submitting your work. Mention what worked or didn't work ,and if you were using the expected workflow. Report precisely the errors or issues you have encountered in the deployment, if any.\n\n## Mandatory Testing\n- Browse the running application and take screenshots to verify functionality\n- Fix issues and restart services until you've verified everything works\n- Save all screenshots in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`\n\nThe application must be fully functional when run with the following command from {workspace_path}/generated-app/:\n```bash\ndocker compose -p zeeter up -d --build\n```\n</DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n\n<README_INSTRUCTIONS>\nREADME instructions:\n  You must create two READMEs for the application:\n  First, a technical TECHNICAL_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. General Implementation\n      - App overview and key features\n      - Tech stack summary\n      - Architecture approach\n  2. Code Structure\n      - Frontend/backend directory layout\n      - Key files and their purposes\n      - Database schema\n\n  Second, a user-friendly USER_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. Navigation Guide to Test the Application\n      - Authentication (admin or not) method if any\n      - Key URLs and actions\n      - If there is an authentication flow, provide default credentials to be able to test the application without recreating an account.\n\n  Note: Exclude startup instructions - app runs via Docker commands in deployment docs\n</README_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n<GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\nGeneral Instructions and Advice:\n  - The folder you are working in is `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace`. You cannot write outside of this folder. It also may contain the following files and folders, that you CANNOT delete in any circumstance (it would break the application):\n  ```\n  /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/\n    .browser_screenshots/\n    .downloads/\n    generated-app/\n  ```\n  - You must create your application in `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace/generated-app/` directory. This is where your docker-compose.yml, .env file, and all application code should be placed.\n  - The .browser_screenshots/ and .downloads/ folders at the `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/google_gemini_3_pro_preview/openhands_google_gemini-3-pro-preview/zeeter/run_20260226_044629_adc9a616/workspace` level must NEVER be deleted or moved - they are used for testing purposes.\n  - If you have trouble loading data in the application, make sure to `docker compose -p zeeter down -v` before running `docker compose -p zeeter up -d` again. It will clear the volumes and start fresh.\n  - Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for all operations.\n  - Strictly restrict yourself to the services you have access to. Do not try to implement services that are not available to you. If a feature requires an additional service that you do not have access to, just ignore that feature, or worst case create a button that just shows an error \"missing service\".\n  - If you encounter issues with the infrastructure you are running in, make sure to put them in your final thoughts before submitting your work. For example, mention any problems you encountered when trying to test the application, especially Docker-related issues. Make sure to report the commands that failed with the error message.\n  - You must focus on doing the full task. Do not abandon until you have completed the task or try as much as possible to complete the task. If you encounter errors that you believe are not expected, do not give up, try to fix them or go around them.\n  - You are on your own, you CANNOT interact with the user at any point. Do not expect them to take any actions after the code is written. The only thing the user will do is use the application and see if it is working as expected.\n  - Before running any UI tests, run the project's seed routine to ensure required data exists and relationships are valid (avoid RLS and constraint errors during evaluation).\n</GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\n\n<TASK_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\nSpecification for the application.

It's not a direct part of the GraphQL query itself, but rather a parameter passed within the function tool call. The error message indicates an unrecognized key, which is probably from my misunderstanding of how the function tool is wrapped. I will analyze the function tool's wrapper logic.\n\n\n**Refining Data Structures**\n\nI've decided to move away from troubleshooting the search_docs tool for now. My focus has shifted to constructing the database schema in Supabase. I'm building a profiles table with id, username, full_name, avatar_url, bio, and updated_at fields. Alongside, I'm defining a posts table with id, user_id, and content (limited to 280 characters).\n\n\n**Defining Database Relationships**\n\nI'm now expanding the Supabase schema. I'm building out relationships. I've designed the `follows` table with `follower_id` and `following_id` referencing the `profiles` table, using a composite primary key. I'm also creating `likes` table with `user_id` and `post_id` as foreign keys. Finally, the `comments` table is getting built with `user_id`, `post_id`, and `content`, to round it out. I am considering simplifying the Notifications table to show recent activity.\n\n\n**Establishing Notification Logic**\n\nI've outlined the schema for a `notifications` table, including `user_id`, `type`, `actor_id`, and `post_id` for tracking interactions. I'll need to define fields for `read` status and timestamps. I intend to write the SQL migration next, then I'll move to the associated RLS policies.\n\n\n",

                "reasoning": "**Refining Migration Strategy**\n\nOkay, I've adjusted my approach. Instead of manually crafting `0001_initial_schema.sql`, I will leverage the `apply_migration` tool to ensure Supabase tracks the version, which will create the file in `supabase/migrations/`.\n\n\n**Applying Migration Plan**\n\nI've got a clearer path forward. The plan is to use the `apply_migration` tool, providing it with names like `20240523000000_initial_schema` and the SQL query. The tool description indicates this is the proper method for DDL operations, which is perfect. I will create the file locally first. The migration plan is set, and currently focuses on enabling `uuid-ossp`, and building out the `profiles` table linked to `auth.users`, complete with a trigger to handle new user sign-ups using a `handle_new_user` function.\n\n\n**Implementing Profile Logic**\n\nI'm now focusing on the `profiles` table. I'm building out its schema with fields like `username`, `full_name`, and `avatar_url`, and implementing constraints such as a minimum username length. Additionally, I've defined Row Level Security (RLS) policies for viewing, inserting, and updating profiles, ensuring proper user access control. I'm also adding a trigger, `handle_new_user`, which will automatically populate the profiles table when new users register via Supabase Auth.\n\n\n**Expanding Data Models**\n\nI'm now expanding the data model. I've defined a `posts` table with user references, content, and timestamps, complete with RLS policies for viewing, inserting, updating, and deleting. I've also created a `follows` table to track user relationships. These are vital for enabling a basic social media feature set and should be tested with sample users.\n\n\n**Defining Social Interactions**\n\nI'm now building out interaction models. I've designed `follows` and `likes` tables, including primary keys and foreign key constraints, enabling user connections and content reactions. I've also implemented Row Level Security policies for these tables, to control access and ensure data integrity.\n\n\n**Constructing Interaction Tables**\n\nNow I'm creating the `comments` and `notifications` tables. The `comments` table will link users to posts with content and timestamps, utilizing RLS policies for viewing, inserting and deleting. I've also implemented a `notifications` table to track interactions like follows, likes, and comments, which also has RLS to control access.\n\n\n**Implementing Storage Policies**\n\nI am now focusing on storage policies. I've defined policies to manage avatars in a 'avatars' bucket, enabling public read access and allowing any user to upload. I've also defined policy to allow users to update their own avatar. Now I'm considering error handling when creating the `avatars` bucket.\n\n\n",

Instead of manually crafting `0001_initial_schema.sql`, I will leverage the `apply_migration` tool to ensure Supabase tracks the version, which will create the file in `supabase/migrations/`.\n\n\n**Applying Migration Plan**\n\nI've got a clearer path forward. The plan is to use the `apply_migration` tool, providing it with names like `20240523000000_initial_schema` and the SQL query. The tool description indicates this is the proper method for DDL operations, which is perfect. I will create the file locally first. The migration plan is set, and currently focuses on enabling `uuid-ossp`, and building out the `profiles` table linked to `auth.users`, complete with a trigger to handle new user sign-ups using a `handle_new_user` function.\n\n\n**Implementing Profile Logic**\n\nI'm now focusing on the `profiles` table. I'm building out its schema with fields like `username`, `full_name`, and `avatar_url`, and implementing constraints such as a minimum username length. Additionally, I've defined Row Level Security (RLS) policies for viewing, inserting, and updating profiles, ensuring proper user access control. I'm also adding a trigger, `handle_new_user`, which will automatically populate the profiles table when new users register via Supabase Auth.\n\n\n**Expanding Data Models**\n\nI'm now expanding the data model. I've defined a `posts` table with user references, content, and timestamps, complete with RLS policies for viewing, inserting, updating, and deleting. I've also created a `follows` table to track user relationships. These are vital for enabling a basic social media feature set and should be tested with sample users.\n\n\n**Defining Social Interactions**\n\nI'm now building out interaction models. I've designed `follows` and `likes` tables, including primary keys and foreign key constraints, enabling user connections and content reactions. I've also implemented Row Level Security policies for these tables, to control access and ensure data integrity.\n\n\n**Constructing Interaction Tables**\n\nNow I'm creating the `comments` and `notifications` tables. The `comments` table will link users to posts with content and timestamps, utilizing RLS policies for viewing, inserting and deleting. I've also implemented a `notifications` table to track interactions like follows, likes, and comments, which also has RLS to control access.\n\n\n**Implementing Storage Policies**\n\nI am now focusing on storage policies. I've defined policies to manage avatars in a 'avatars' bucket, enabling public read access and allowing any user to upload. I've also defined policy to allow users to update their own avatar. Now I'm considering error handling when creating the `avatars` bucket.\n\n\n",

My primary focus is on developing the `src/pages/Home.jsx` file, which will host the post creation form for logged-in users and a comprehensive post feed. I am currently working on a `Post` component at `src/components/Post.jsx` to render post content, including functionality for liking, deleting (for the owner), and possibly commenting.\n\n\n**Refining Post Interaction**\n\nI'm now focusing on refining the post interaction components. I am planning the post detail page navigation. I will likely implement a simple expansion for interaction, or a dedicated post detail page. Date formatting with `date-fns` looks good. I have a `Post` component with liking and commenting components and am considering how to handle click events on the post itself.\n\n\n**Implementing Post Header Details**\n\nI'm now integrating the post header details, including the avatar, full name, username, and time since creation. I've added a link to the profile page, and I'm currently working on correctly passing event handlers to avoid unintended propagation when clicking on these elements. I'm also addressing the like button styling.\n\n\n",

I am planning the post detail page navigation. I will likely implement a simple expansion for interaction, or a dedicated post detail page. Date formatting with `date-fns` looks good. I have a `Post` component with liking and commenting components and am considering how to handle click events on the post itself.\n\n\n**Implementing Post Header Details**\n\nI'm now integrating the post header details, including the avatar, full name, username, and time since creation.

My next step involves creating `src/pages/Home.jsx` to continue this work.\n\n\n**Developing Post Interaction**\n\nI'm now integrating post interaction features. I've begun importing necessary UI components like `Button`, `Textarea`, `Avatar` and `Post`. Further, I've integrated `useAuth` and `useLocation` hooks for auth management and navigation. I'm focusing on the implementation of `fetchPosts` using supabase, incorporating ordering, and fetching related data for users and interactions. Lastly, I'm working to handle post creation.\n\n\n**Implementing Post Creation**\n\nI'm now focusing on post creation, and I've started the implementation within the existing UI structure, adding a `Textarea` for content input. I'm handling the submission with error checking, restricting post content to 280 characters. I've also integrated Supabase for inserting new posts, including user ID. Upon successful submission, I clear the content field and re-fetch posts.\n\n\n**Refining Post Display**\n\nI'm now focusing on refining the post display. I've integrated a character counter and button for posting, which is disabled if content is empty or exceeds the limit. I'm also ensuring the character limit is enforced by error checking, and I've wired up the button and counter to submit new posts using supabase, managing user IDs. On successful submission, the content field is cleared and I re-fetch posts.\n\n\n",

I'm working on displaying the post content, its associated comments, and implementing a comment form, which will conditionally render based on user login status. I'm leveraging `useEffect` and `useState` with Supabase integration to manage data flow and component states.\n\n\n**Refining Post Detail**\n\nI've integrated the `useAuth` hook and `useParams` to manage user context and dynamic routing within `PostDetail.jsx`. I'm using `useState` to manage post details, comments, and the comment form state, along with a `loading` state. I've also incorporated date formatting for display, and introduced the components for the UI elements, like buttons, text areas and avatars.\n\n\n**Fetching Post Data**\n\nI'm now focusing on efficiently retrieving post data and associated comments using Supabase. I've implemented a two-step approach: first fetching the post details and then fetching the comments, including user profiles, from the comments table. I'm handling potential errors, setting state variables for the post and comments data, and considering an optimistic update approach for comments insertion to streamline UI responsiveness.\n\n\n**Implementing Comment Display**\n\nI've successfully integrated the retrieval of comments, including associated user profiles, into `PostDetail.jsx`. I'm using a Supabase query with joins to fetch data and order it chronologically. I'm handling the cases where a post might not exist, or the data is still loading. Now, I have implemented conditional rendering for both the loading state and the post content, displaying an appropriate message in case of errors.\n\n\n**Integrating Comment Handling**\n\nI've integrated the comment display and form within the component. I've conditionally rendered the reply form based on the user's login status, implementing `Textarea` and `Button` UI elements, alongside the functionality for capturing comment content with an `onChange` handler and managing the disabled state of the reply button. Currently, I'm working through the logic for the comment submission functionality, which has to handle the post of the comment to the database.\n\n\n**Enhancing Comment Display**\n\nI'm now refining the comment display within `PostDetail.jsx`, focusing on enhancing the UI presentation. I've integrated `Avatar` components from the UI library to display user avatars, alongside links to user profiles using `Link` components for seamless navigation. I'm also including user names, usernames, and a relative timestamp using `formatDistanceToNow` for clarity. I'm leveraging Tailwind classes to handle spacing, responsiveness, and consistent styling for the display of each comment.\n\n\n",

I'm working on displaying the post content, its associated comments, and implementing a comment form, which will conditionally render based on user login status. I'm leveraging `useEffect` and `useState` with Supabase integration to manage data flow and component states.\n\n\n**Refining Post Detail**\n\nI've integrated the `useAuth` hook and `useParams` to manage user context and dynamic routing within `PostDetail.jsx`. I'm using `useState` to manage post details, comments, and the comment form state, along with a `loading` state. I've also incorporated date formatting for display, and introduced the components for the UI elements, like buttons, text areas and avatars.\n\n\n**Fetching Post Data**\n\nI'm now focusing on efficiently retrieving post data and associated comments using Supabase. I've implemented a two-step approach: first fetching the post details and then fetching the comments, including user profiles, from the comments table. I'm handling potential errors, setting state variables for the post and comments data, and considering an optimistic update approach for comments insertion to streamline UI responsiveness.\n\n\n**Implementing Comment Display**\n\nI've successfully integrated the retrieval of comments, including associated user profiles, into `PostDetail.jsx`. I'm using a Supabase query with joins to fetch data and order it chronologically. I'm handling the cases where a post might not exist, or the data is still loading. Now, I have implemented conditional rendering for both the loading state and the post content, displaying an appropriate message in case of errors.\n\n\n**Integrating Comment Handling**\n\nI've integrated the comment display and form within the component. I've conditionally rendered the reply form based on the user's login status, implementing `Textarea` and `Button` UI elements, alongside the functionality for capturing comment content with an `onChange` handler and managing the disabled state of the reply button. Currently, I'm working through the logic for the comment submission functionality, which has to handle the post of the comment to the database.\n\n\n**Enhancing Comment Display**\n\nI'm now refining the comment display within `PostDetail.jsx`, focusing on enhancing the UI presentation. I've integrated `Avatar` components from the UI library to display user avatars, alongside links to user profiles using `Link` components for seamless navigation. I'm also including user names, usernames, and a relative timestamp using `formatDistanceToNow` for clarity. I'm leveraging Tailwind classes to handle spacing, responsiveness, and consistent styling for the display of each comment.\n\n\n",

It initially navigates to the detailed view, which then re-renders the `Post` component. Click handlers within the `Post` component, when rendered inside `PostDetail`, must be carefully managed to avoid recursion or simply be disabled in this context.\n\n\n**Refining Profile Page Logic**\n\nI'm now implementing the profile page, located at `src/pages/Profile.jsx`. It will include user information, a follow button (if not the user's own profile), and a display of the user's posts. I'm using `supabase` for data fetching and the `useAuth` hook for user context. I've begun to structure the UI, incorporating components like `Avatar`, `Button`, and the `Post` component to display individual posts.\n\n\n**Implementing Profile Data Retrieval**\n\nI'm focusing on the data retrieval for the profile page now. I've added a `useEffect` hook to fetch profile details, posts, and follow status from Supabase. I handle the loading state, and I've ensured to update the profile and posts states accordingly, including fetching data and handling potential errors. The conditional follow status retrieval is also in place, considering the user's login state.\n\n\n**Managing Follow Interaction**\n\nI'm now integrating the \"follow\" functionality. I've got the `handleFollow` function, which manages following and unfollowing based on the `isFollowing` state. It calls Supabase for updates and inserts data into the `follows` table. Importantly, when someone starts following, I am now also inserting notifications to the relevant user's table, to notify them. I'm handling potential scenarios like no user logged in, or the loading/not found states.\n\n\n**Structuring Profile Component Details**\n\nI'm now integrating the profile detail section within the `Profile` component. I've structured the display to include the user's full name, post count, and an avatar. A conditional follow/unfollow button is implemented, contingent upon whether the current user's ID matches the profile ID. An edit button is displayed when it is the user's profile.\n\n\n**Integrating Profile Component Details**\n\nI've just added the profile detail section to the `Profile` component. It features the user's full name and username. I've included the user's biography and joining date, formatted using `format`. Additionally, I've added a section for the number of following. This will display statically for now.\n\n\n**Displaying Interaction Metrics**\n\nI'm now integrating the display of followers, posts, replies, and likes into the profile view. The component is structured with distinct sections for each metric. The follower count is included. I've designed a clear visual structure with a border and hover effects to guide user interaction. I've included the post display, and created conditional displays for replies and likes. I'm focusing on the Posts.\n\n\n",

The conditional follow status retrieval is also in place, considering the user's login state.\n\n\n**Managing Follow Interaction**\n\nI'm now integrating the \"follow\" functionality. I've got the `handleFollow` function, which manages following and unfollowing based on the `isFollowing` state. It calls Supabase for updates and inserts data into the `follows` table. Importantly, when someone starts following, I am now also inserting notifications to the relevant user's table, to notify them. I'm handling potential scenarios like no user logged in, or the loading/not found states.\n\n\n**Structuring Profile Component Details**\n\nI'm now integrating the profile detail section within the `Profile` component. I've structured the display to include the user's full name, post count, and an avatar. A conditional follow/unfollow button is implemented, contingent upon whether the current user's ID matches the profile ID. An edit button is displayed when it is the user's profile.\n\n\n**Integrating Profile Component Details**\n\nI've just added the profile detail section to the `Profile` component. It features the user's full name and username. I've included the user's biography and joining date, formatted using `format`. Additionally, I've added a section for the number of following. This will display statically for now.\n\n\n**Displaying Interaction Metrics**\n\nI'm now integrating the display of followers, posts, replies, and likes into the profile view. The component is structured with distinct sections for each metric. The follower count is included. I've designed a clear visual structure with a border and hover effects to guide user interaction. I've included the post display, and created conditional displays for replies and likes. I'm focusing on the Posts.\n\n\n",

I'm leveraging the `Avatar` component with fallback initials from the user's name and displaying the notification type text, such as 'liked your post' or 'followed you.' I'm also handling the display of the post content itself if it exists, using a line-clamp for readability. I'm focusing on a clean, concise layout for each notification entry and displaying a loading state.\n\n\n**Debugging Supabase Joins**\n\nI'm now troubleshooting the Supabase join for the `profiles` table using the `actor_id` field. I was initially unsure whether to use the table name `profiles`, a foreign key constraint name like `profiles!notifications_actor_id_fkey`, or the column name as the resource. I've been experimenting with these different approaches and realized that since there are two foreign key references to `profiles`, I need to be explicit about which one to use in the join. I am looking to confirm the constraint name via `information_schema`. I'll start with the sidepanel.\n\n\n",

The naming convention is quite clear and standard. I'm now looking at the Supabase client implementation, focusing on the `select` statement and its aliasing of the foreign key relationships.\n\n\n**Refining Relation Syntax**\n\nI've clarified the relation syntax; it's `table!constraint`. Examples are `profiles!notifications_actor_id_fkey` or simply `profiles!notifications_actor_id_fkey`. Moving forward, I am investigating how this relates to the Supabase client implementation, focusing on the interactions within the `select` statement. The goal is to fully understand how these relations are being utilized in the application's data fetching strategy.\n\n\n**Interpreting Data Fetching**\n\nI'm now focused on how the `select` statement integrates the relation syntax, specifically in the context of data fetching. I'm examining how related data is fetched using aliasing, specifically `actor:profiles!notifications_actor_id_fkey` and `post:posts!notifications_post_id_fkey` within the Supabase client implementation. I need to fully interpret the logic of the `select` statement for fetching related data.\n\n\n**Deciphering Notification Context**\n\nI'm now diving into the specific rendering logic of notification types within the UI. I'm focusing on the conditional rendering of icons based on `notif.type`, specifically examining how `post_like`, `start_following`, and `post_comment` trigger different icons, such as a heart, a user, or a message circle. I'm also noting the use of the `actor` object to populate avatar details and profile links.\n\n\n**Understanding UI Rendering**\n\nI'm now examining how notification content is dynamically generated within the user interface, including full names and usernames. I've noted conditional statements tied to notification types; these dictate the display of actions such as 'liked your post' and 'started following you'. Furthermore, I've observed the use of the `formatDistanceToNow` function to present relative time stamps, as well as the rendering of post content if present. I'm focusing on the integration of related data, such as actor and post data, into the displayed notification.\n\n\n",

I've integrated Supabase for searching both posts and profiles, utilizing `ilike` for case-insensitive matching. It's now capable of searching the post content, usernames, and full names. I've also incorporated limits and ordering to optimize results. The search results are updating dynamically, showing both post and profile results.\n\n\n**Implementing Search Refinements**\n\nI've just added a basic loading state indicator, showing \"Searching...\" while the results are being fetched. I've also integrated a clear visual division between search result sections. I'm now refining the display of the search results, specifically the profiles and posts. I'm leveraging a layout for a cleaner, more readable presentation.\n\n\n**Improving Result Display**\n\nI've just focused on refining the presentation of search results. I'm now leveraging components like `Avatar` and `Link` to enhance the display of profiles, including their avatars and usernames, making them more visually appealing and navigable. I've also implemented a clearer division between profiles and posts, improving overall readability of the search results page.\n\n\n",

I'm evaluating the best method with react-router-dom, specifically weighing the options between `createBrowserRouter` and `BrowserRouter`. I'm starting to think I might need to revise what is in `App.jsx`, too.\n\n\n**Implementing RouterProvider**\n\nI have integrated `RouterProvider` with `createBrowserRouter` within `App.jsx`, structuring the routes as children of a layout component. The code now includes routes for home, login, signup, profiles, notifications, post details, and search, which I think is a solid foundation. I will refactor more as needed.\n\n\n",

Currently, I plan to either use a `seed.js` script or go with direct SQL queries. I need to ensure the seeding process is idempotent and document how to execute it, as instructed in the prompt.\n\n\n**Refining Authentication Integration**\n\nI've determined that direct SQL insertion for authentication is problematic due to Supabase role restrictions. I'm now crafting a `frontend/scripts/seed.js` script to create users programmatically using the Supabase Service Role Key. I will leverage `@supabase/supabase-js`, importing `createClient` and utilizing environment variables for the service key. I need to ensure the script properly handles the user creation process.\n\n\n**Implementing User Creation Script**\n\nI'm now integrating the Supabase client and crafting a function to programmatically create users. I've set up checks for missing environment variables. I'm focusing on the user creation loop and error handling. I'm logging success and potential \"user already exists\" errors, and then logging any error that occurs. I'll need to decide whether to attempt to pull existing user IDs if creation fails.\n\n\n**Addressing User ID Retrieval**\n\nI'm now handling scenarios where user creation conflicts occur. If a user already exists, I will try to retrieve their ID. I'm leveraging `supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()` to fetch the existing user list, then identify users by email. If found, I will extract the user ID. I'm working on retrieving post creation IDs, for the posts I want to create, since I may need those to seed posts.\n\n\n**Refining Script Dependencies**\n\nI'm now integrating necessary dependencies for the seeding script, specifically focusing on `dotenv`. I've determined that the best approach involves placing the `seed.js` script within `generated-app` and running it directly. I'll handle environment variables through `dotenv` which I will install, alongside `@supabase/supabase-js`, within the `generated-app` directory. I'll need to check the dependencies location and make sure that it's correctly used.\n\n\n",

I'm now crafting a `frontend/scripts/seed.js` script to create users programmatically using the Supabase Service Role Key. I will leverage `@supabase/supabase-js`, importing `createClient` and utilizing environment variables for the service key. I need to ensure the script properly handles the user creation process.\n\n\n**Implementing User Creation Script**\n\nI'm now integrating the Supabase client and crafting a function to programmatically create users. I've set up checks for missing environment variables. I'm focusing on the user creation loop and error handling. I'm logging success and potential \"user already exists\" errors, and then logging any error that occurs. I'll need to decide whether to attempt to pull existing user IDs if creation fails.\n\n\n**Addressing User ID Retrieval**\n\nI'm now handling scenarios where user creation conflicts occur. If a user already exists, I will try to retrieve their ID. I'm leveraging `supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()` to fetch the existing user list, then identify users by email. If found, I will extract the user ID. I'm working on retrieving post creation IDs, for the posts I want to create, since I may need those to seed posts.\n\n\n**Refining Script Dependencies**\n\nI'm now integrating necessary dependencies for the seeding script, specifically focusing on `dotenv`. I've determined that the best approach involves placing the `seed.js` script within `generated-app` and running it directly. I'll handle environment variables through `dotenv` which I will install, alongside `@supabase/supabase-js`, within the `generated-app` directory.

I've realized it needs to be an `.js` or `.mjs` file due to the ESM module, and I'll use `dotenv` and `createClient`. I'm going to access the `.env` file from the root using `../.env`.\n\n\n**Refining Script Details**\n\nI've got the seed script's foundation solidified. I'm now importing `createClient`, `dotenv`, and relevant path utilities. Error handling for missing Supabase environment variables is also incorporated. I'm also ensuring the correct path resolution for the `.env` file, and I've instantiated the Supabase client. I've begun to structure the seeding logic, including a list of initial users.\n\n\n**Implementing User Creation Logic**\n\nI'm now integrating the user creation loop. I'm focusing on handling potential errors from duplicate emails by checking the existing users. I'm also logging user creation success. I'm then going to push the new users to the created users list, which will be accessible downstream. The creation logic incorporates checks to prevent duplicate users.\n\n\n**Adding Post Data**\n\nI'm now adding post data to the seed script, using a sample set of posts with content and associated user IDs, utilizing `upsert` for potential mockups. The script then handles a follow relationship, where Bob follows Alice, and logs this action. I am also implementing like data on Alice's posts, using the post IDs. I am going to make sure to incorporate error handling and logging at each step.\n\n\n",

I'm going to access the `.env` file from the root using `../.env`.\n\n\n**Refining Script Details**\n\nI've got the seed script's foundation solidified. I'm now importing `createClient`, `dotenv`, and relevant path utilities. Error handling for missing Supabase environment variables is also incorporated. I'm also ensuring the correct path resolution for the `.env` file, and I've instantiated the Supabase client. I've begun to structure the seeding logic, including a list of initial users.\n\n\n**Implementing User Creation Logic**\n\nI'm now integrating the user creation loop. I'm focusing on handling potential errors from duplicate emails by checking the existing users. I'm also logging user creation success. I'm then going to push the new users to the created users list, which will be accessible downstream. The creation logic incorporates checks to prevent duplicate users.\n\n\n**Adding Post Data**\n\nI'm now adding post data to the seed script, using a sample set of posts with content and associated user IDs, utilizing `upsert` for potential mockups. The script then handles a follow relationship, where Bob follows Alice, and logs this action. I am also implementing like data on Alice's posts, using the post IDs. I am going to make sure to incorporate error handling and logging at each step.\n\n\n",

I'm beginning the implementation of `generated-app/Dockerfile.frontend`, focusing on using `node:22-alpine` as the base image and setting the working directory to `/app`. I'll copy the `package*.json` files and then run `npm install`.\n\n\n**Refining Docker Configuration**\n\nI've added the `COPY . .` command to transfer all project files, followed by `npm run build` to compile the frontend inside the container. I've set the exposed port to 4173 and specified the command to run the preview server. I realized the default port is indeed 4173 and am enforcing host 0.0.0.0. Also, I've created the `generated-app/docker-compose.yml` file, defining the `zeeter` service with build context and port mappings. I'm now focusing on ensuring environment variables are available during the build process, since this is a static frontend. The `env_file` or `environment` in `docker-compose.yml` will be setting these at runtime, but I need them at build.\n\n\n**Considering Environment Variables**\n\nI'm now focusing on how environment variables behave with `vite build` within Docker. I'm exploring different approaches, such as passing build arguments or ensuring the `.env` file is present during the build process. I'm considering potential issues if the `.env` file is ignored or not updated, and how to make sure the frontend container uses the latest variables. I'm reevaluating the interplay between `docker-compose.yml` and the `frontend/.env` file. To ensure dynamic updates, I'm thinking I might need to copy the `.env` file during the Docker build.\n\n\n**Implementing Build Arguments**\n\nI've decided to employ `ARG` within the `Dockerfile` in combination with `build: args:` in `docker-compose.yml` to securely manage environment variables. This approach enables dynamic updates by passing variables during build time. The Dockerfile now incorporates `ARG` directives for `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. These values are passed from `docker-compose`, which reads these values from the `.env` file, ensuring consistent configuration.

In my thought process, I need to check whether the button actually gets enabled. I can't check that during a browser tool call easily.

My focus is on the database and data retrieval. I'm suspecting `fetchPosts` might be failing, despite the initial seeding.

The user ID `229a03a2-f9b5-4f9b-b649-ba7a7bbcb5a2` in the `profiles` table corresponds to the `user_id` in the \"Hello from Alice!\" post. The foreign key appears valid, but I'm looking into how the Supabase client infers these relationships.\n\n\n**Investigating Foreign Key Syntax**\n\nI'm now focusing on the foreign key constraints in Supabase, particularly how the client infers relationships with foreign resource requests, and also aggregation-based column requests. I've been experimenting with `comments(count)` and how that impacts the returned data structure. The way I implemented the call to `count` with `comments` might be the problem.\n\n\n**Refining Error Handling**\n\nI'm currently focused on improving error handling. I'm going to change the `console.error(error)` calls in both `Home.jsx` and `PostDetail.jsx` to `setError(error.message)`. This will allow me to display the error messages on the screen, which should make debugging easier. I suspect that the `comments(count)` aggregation is fine, and let's make sure our RLS policies are fine. After I fix error handling, I will simplify the query in `Home.jsx` to debugging.\n\n\n",

The initial SQL check was solid, proving the data exists. Now, I'm digging into `Home.jsx`, aiming to catch any error messages that might be lurking and silently preventing the posts from being rendered. Let's see if we can expose the culprit!\n\n\n**Investigating the Data**\n\nI'm now focusing on the data itself. A screenshot revealed the UI shows \"No posts yet,\" even with no error messages, implying an empty `posts` state. However, the SQL query result shows actual posts exist, specifically for user ID `229a03a2-f9b5-4f9b-b649-ba7a7bbcb5a2`. Looks like a mismatch between what's fetched and what's expected.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Database Joins**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the Supabase query. My concern revolves around the `profiles` join within `Home.jsx`. It's possible that if a user's profile is inaccessible due to RLS policies or a join issue, the query returns null for the profiles field, even if the post itself exists. I'll need to check the `profiles` table to see if the user ID, `229a03a2-f9b5-4f9b-b649-ba7a7bbcb5a2`, has valid access.\n\n\n**Examining the Seeding Script**\n\nThe foreign keys on `posts` match, and RLS policies are permissive. The seeding script clearly *creates* posts, so the data should be there. Perhaps the issue lies in the Supabase JS client function `.select('*, comments(count)')`. I'm going to look into how the `comments` count is handled to see if this is causing the posts not to appear.\n\n\n**Refining the Query Syntax**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the Supabase query structure, specifically the `comments(count)` part. Initially, I was confused about how this handled counting comments. After consulting the docs, I understand that newer PostgREST/Supabase versions support `comments(count)` directly in the select string to get the count. If that isn't working, I suspect a data formatting mismatch. I'm going to remove this and test a raw query.\n\n\n**Simplifying the Selection**\n\nI'm removing the `comments(count)` and `likes(user_id)` parts to simplify the query and isolate if basic post fetching works. I'm also adding a display on the screen to show the raw `data` as a JSON string to debug the content that's actually returned from the query. I suspect the issue might be with how the complex parts are being interpreted. I'm going to start with a bare-bones query, then add complexity back in after confirming that posts appear with the simpler query.\n\n\n",

However, the SQL query result shows actual posts exist, specifically for user ID `229a03a2-f9b5-4f9b-b649-ba7a7bbcb5a2`. Looks like a mismatch between what's fetched and what's expected.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Database Joins**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the Supabase query. My concern revolves around the `profiles` join within `Home.jsx`. It's possible that if a user's profile is inaccessible due to RLS policies or a join issue, the query returns null for the profiles field, even if the post itself exists. I'll need to check the `profiles` table to see if the user ID, `229a03a2-f9b5-4f9b-b649-ba7a7bbcb5a2`, has valid access.\n\n\n**Examining the Seeding Script**\n\nThe foreign keys on `posts` match, and RLS policies are permissive. The seeding script clearly *creates* posts, so the data should be there. Perhaps the issue lies in the Supabase JS client function `.select('*, comments(count)')`. I'm going to look into how the `comments` count is handled to see if this is causing the posts not to appear.\n\n\n**Refining the Query Syntax**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the Supabase query structure, specifically the `comments(count)` part. Initially, I was confused about how this handled counting comments. After consulting the docs, I understand that newer PostgREST/Supabase versions support `comments(count)` directly in the select string to get the count. If that isn't working, I suspect a data formatting mismatch. I'm going to remove this and test a raw query.\n\n\n**Simplifying the Selection**\n\nI'm removing the `comments(count)` and `likes(user_id)` parts to simplify the query and isolate if basic post fetching works. I'm also adding a display on the screen to show the raw `data` as a JSON string to debug the content that's actually returned from the query. I suspect the issue might be with how the complex parts are being interpreted. I'm going to start with a bare-bones query, then add complexity back in after confirming that posts appear with the simpler query.\n\n\n",

Users and posts were created, but the homepage still displays \"No posts yet.\" I'm currently trying to debug this issue by checking the route configuration and the data fetching logic to ensure the posts are being queried and rendered correctly.\n\n\n**Investigating Database Connection**\n\nI've simplified the query in `Home.jsx` to `select('*')` to eliminate potential logic errors. Despite confirming the existence of posts via `execute_sql`, the frontend persistently shows \"No posts yet,\" suggesting the `posts` state isn't being populated. I'm now suspecting an issue with the relationship between `profiles` and `posts`, despite the matching user IDs, and will investigate that area.\n\n\n**Analyzing Empty Data Response**\n\nI'm now focusing on why a basic `select('*')` query on the 'posts' table returns an empty array, even though posts exist and RLS is enabled. The `loading` state is false, and there's no error message, indicating a successful but empty data fetch. My current thought process is centered around examining if the foreign key relationship between `posts` and `profiles`, based on `user_id`, is correctly established and functioning as expected despite Supabase inferring the relation correctly.\n\n\n**Checking Supabase Configuration**\n\nI'm now investigating potential environment variable issues. I updated `frontend/.env` with the correct Supabase URL and key. Since there are no connection or 401 errors, those variables are likely fine. I suspect an issue with `created_at` timestamp. I've added a console log and am trying to show the raw `posts` data to confirm if the fetch is happening and the data is coming through.\n\n\n**Verifying RLS Bypass**\n\nI've just applied a migration to bypass RLS with `create policy \"Posts are viewable by everyone.\"`. Now, I'm verifying the policy's application with `execute_sql` to confirm. I'm also ensuring the environment variables, which are set during the Docker build process, are correctly configured. I'm focusing on the discrepancy between the Supabase URL in my `.env` file and the browser's access URL, suspecting this might be a configuration issue.\n\n\n",

Supabase provides all the backend features developers need to build a product: a Postgres database, authentication, instant APIs, edge functions, real-time subscriptions, and storage. Postgres is the core of Supabase\\u2014for example, you can use row-level security, and there are more than 40 Postgres extensions available.\\\\n\\\\nThis guide demonstrates how to migrate your Postgres database to Supabase to get the most out of Postgres while gaining access to all the features you need to build a project.\\\\n\\\\nThis guide provides three methods for migrating your Postgres database to Supabase:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Google Colab** - Guided notebook with copy-paste workflow\\\\n2.  **Manual Dump/Restore** - CLI approach, works for all versions\\\\n3.  **Logical Replication** - Minimal downtime, requires Postgres 10+\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Connection modes\\\\n\\\\nSupabase provides the following connection modes:\\\\n\\\\n*   Direct connection\\\\n*   Supavisor session mode\\\\n*   Supavisor transaction mode\\\\n\\\\nUse Supavisor session mode for the database migration tasks (pg\\\\\\\\_dump/restore and logical replication).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Method 1: Google Colab (easiest)\\\\n\\\\nSupabase provides a Google Colab migration notebook for a guided migration experience:\\\\n[Supabase Migration Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mansueli/Supa-Migrate/blob/main/Migrate_Postgres_Supabase.ipynb)\\\\n\\\\nThis is ideal if you prefer a step-by-step, copy-paste workflow with minimal setup.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Method 2: Manual dump/restore\\\\n\\\\nThis method works for all Postgres versions using CLI tools.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Prerequisites\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Source Postgres requirements\\\\n\\\\n*   Connection string with rights to run `pg_dump`\\\\n*   No special settings required for dump/restore\\\\n*   Network access from migration VM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Migration environment\\\\n\\\\n*   Cloud VM running Ubuntu in the same region as source or target database\\\\n*   Postgres client tools matching your source database version\\\\n*   tmux for session persistence\\\\n*   Sufficient disk space (usually ~50% of source database size is enough, but varies case by case)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Pre-Migration checklist\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Check database size\\\\nselect pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) as size;\\\\n\\\\n-- Check Postgres version\\\\nselect version();\\\\n\\\\n-- List installed extensions\\\\nselect * from pg_extension order by extname;\\\\n\\\\n-- Check active connections\\\\nselect count(*) from pg_stat_activity;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Check available extensions in Supabase\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Connect to your Supabase database and check available extensions\\\\nSELECT name, comment FROM pg_available_extensions ORDER BY name;\\\\n\\\\n-- Compare with source database extensions\\\\nSELECT extname FROM pg_extension ORDER BY extname;\\\\n\\\\n-- Install needed extensions\\\\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS extension_name;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Step 1: Set up migration VM\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"tip\\\\\\\">\\\\n  For optimal performance, run the migration from a cloud VM, not your local machine. The VM should be in the same region as either your source or target database to optimize network performance. See the Resource Requirements table in Step 2 for VM sizing recommendations.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Set up Ubuntu VM\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\n# Install Postgres client and tools\\\\nsudo apt update\\\\nsudo apt install software-properties-common\\\\nsudo sh -c 'echo \\\\\\\"deb http://apt.Postgres.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main\\\\\\\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'\\\\nwget --quiet -O - https://www.Postgres.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\\\\nsudo apt update\\\\nsudo apt install Postgres-client-17 tmux htop iotop moreutils\\\\n\\\\n# Start or attach to tmux session\\\\ntmux a -t migration || tmux new -s migration\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Step 2: Prepare Supabase project\\\\n\\\\n1.

Storage objects transfer or redeploying edge functions is not covered here.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Before you begin\\\\n\\\\nYou need:\\\\n\\\\n*   A new self-hosted Supabase instance ([Docker setup guide](/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker))\\\\n*   [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) installed (or use `npx supabase`)\\\\n*   [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) installed (required by the CLI)\\\\n*   `psql` installed ([official installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/))\\\\n*   Your Supabase database passwords (for platform and self-hosted)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 1: Get your platform connection string\\\\n\\\\nOn your managed Supabase project dashboard, click [**Connect**](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) and copy the connection string (use the session pooler or direct connection).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 2: Back up your platform database\\\\n\\\\nExport roles, schema, and data as three separate SQL files:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nsupabase db dump --db-url \\\\\\\"[CONNECTION_STRING]\\\\\\\" -f roles.sql --role-only\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nsupabase db dump --db-url \\\\\\\"[CONNECTION_STRING]\\\\\\\" -f schema.sql\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nsupabase db dump --db-url \\\\\\\"[CONNECTION_STRING]\\\\\\\" -f data.sql --use-copy --data-only\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis produces SQL files that are compatible across Postgres versions.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Using `supabase db dump` executes `pg_dump` under the hood but applies Supabase-specific filtering - it excludes internal schemas, strips reserved roles, and adds idempotent `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses. Using raw `pg_dump` directly will include Supabase internals and cause permission errors during restore. CLI requires Docker because it runs `pg_dump` inside a container from the Supabase Postgres image rather than requiring a local Postgres installation.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 3: Prepare your self-hosted instance\\\\n\\\\nBefore restoring, check the following on your self-hosted instance:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Extensions**: Enable any non-default extensions your Supabase project uses. You can check which extensions are active by querying `select * from pg_extension;` on your managed database (or check Database Extensions in Dashboard).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 4: Restore to your self-hosted database\\\\n\\\\nConnect to your self-hosted Postgres and restore the dump files. The [default](/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#accessing-postgres) connection string for self-hosted Supabase is:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\npostgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhere `[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]` is the value of `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in your self-hosted `.env` file.\\\\n\\\\nUse your domain name, your server IP, or localhost for `[your-domain]` depending on whether you are running self-hosted Supabase on a VPS, or locally.\\\\n\\\\nRun `psql` to restore:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npsql \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --single-transaction \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --variable ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --file roles.sql \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --file schema.sql \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --command 'SET session_replication_role = replica' \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --file data.sql \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --dbname \\\\\\\"postgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nSetting `session_replication_role` to `replica` disables triggers during the data import, preventing issues like double-encryption of columns.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 5: Verify the restore\\\\n\\\\nConnect to your self-hosted database and run a few checks:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npsql \\\\\\\"postgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Check your tables are present\\\\n\\\\\\\\dt public.*\\\\n\\\\n-- Verify row counts on key tables\\\\nSELECT count(*) FROM auth.users;\\\\n\\\\n-- Check extensions\\\\nSELECT * FROM pg_extension;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## What's included and what's not\\\\n\\\\nThe database dump includes your schema, data, roles, RLS policies, database functions, triggers, and `auth.users`. However, several things require separate configuration on your self-hosted instance:\\\\n\\\\n| Requires manual setup                       | How to configure                                  |\\\\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| JWT secrets and API keys                    | Generate new ones and update `.env`               |\\\\n| Auth provider settings (OAuth, Apple, etc.) | Configure `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_*` variables in `.env` |\\\\n| Edge functions                              | Manually copy to your self-hosted instance        |\\\\n| Storage objects                             | Transfer separately (not covered in this guide)   |\\\\n| SMTP / email settings                       | Configure `SMTP_*` variables in `.env`            |\\\\n| Custom domains and DNS                      | Point your DNS to the self-hosted server          |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Auth considerations\\\\n\\\\nYour `auth.users` table and related data are included in the database dump, so user accounts are preserved. However:\\\\n\\\\n*   **JWT secrets differ** between your platform and self-hosted instances. Existing tokens issued by the platform project will not be valid. Users will need to re-authenticate.\\\\n*   **Social auth providers** (Apple, Google, GitHub, etc.) need to be configured in your self-hosted `.env` file. Set the relevant `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_*` variables. See the Auth repository [README](https://github.com/supabase/auth) for all available options.\\\\n*   **Redirect URLs** in your OAuth provider consoles (Apple Developer, Google Cloud Console, etc.) must be updated to point to your self-hosted hostname instead of `*.supabase.co`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Postgres version compatibility\\\\n\\\\nManaged Supabase may run a newer Postgres version (Postgres 17) than the self-hosted Docker image (currently Postgres 15). The `supabase db dump` command produces plain SQL files that work across major Postgres versions.\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind:\\\\n\\\\n*   The data dump may include Postgres 17-only settings or reference tables/columns from newer Auth and Storage versions that don't exist on self-hosted yet. See [Version mismatches](#version-mismatches-between-platform-and-self-hosted) in the troubleshooting section.\\\\n*   Run the restore on a test self-hosted instance first to identify any incompatibilities.\\\\n*   Check that all extensions you use are available on the self-hosted Postgres version.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Troubleshooting\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Version mismatches between platform and self-hosted\\\\n\\\\nThe platform may run a newer Postgres version (17 vs 15) and newer Auth service versions than self-hosted. The data dump can contain settings, tables, or columns that don't exist on your new self-hosted instance.\\\\n\\\\n**Common issues in `data.sql`:**\\\\n\\\\n*   `SET transaction_timeout = 0` - a Postgres 17-only setting that fails on Postgres 15\\\\n*   `COPY` statements for tables that don't exist on self-hosted (e.g., `auth.oauth_clients`, `storage.buckets_vectors`, `storage.vector_indexes`)\\\\n*   `COPY` statements with columns added in newer Auth versions (e.g., `auth.flow_state` with `oauth_client_state_id`, `linking_target_id`)\\\\n\\\\n**Workaround:** Edit `data.sql` before restoring:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\n# Comment out PG17-only transaction_timeout\\\\nsed -i 's/^SET transaction_timeout/-- &/' data.sql\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor missing tables or column mismatches, comment out the relevant `COPY ... FROM stdin;` line and its corresponding `\\\\\\\\.` terminator. Run the restore without `--single-transaction` first to identify all failures, then fix them and run the final restore with `--single-transaction`.\\\\n\\\\nKeeping your self-hosted configuration [up to date](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker/CHANGELOG.md) will minimize these gaps.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Extension not available\\\\n\\\\nIf the restore fails because an extension isn't available, check whether it's supported on your self-hosted Postgres version. You can list available extensions with:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Connection refused\\\\n\\\\nMake sure your self-hosted Postgres port is accessible. In the default [self-hosted Supabase](/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#accessing-postgres) setup, the user is `postgres.your-tenant-id` with Supavisor on port `5432`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Legacy Studio configuration\\\\n\\\\nStudio in self-hosted Supabase historically used `supabase_admin` role (superuser) instead of `postgres`. Objects created via Studio UI were owned by `supabase_admin`. Check your `docker-compose.yml` [configuration](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/2cb5befaa377a42b6d6ca152b98105b59054f2f4/docker/docker-compose.yml#L30) to see if `POSTGRES_USER_READ_WRITE` is set to `postgres`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Custom roles missing passwords\\\\n\\\\nIf you created custom database roles with the `LOGIN` attribute on your platform project, their passwords are not included in the dump. Set them manually after restore:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nALTER ROLE your_custom_role WITH PASSWORD 'new-password';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Additional resources\\\\n\\\\n*   [Backup and Restore using the CLI](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/backup-restore)\\\\n*   [Restore Dashboard backup](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/dashboard-restore)\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Tables and Data\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Tables and Data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTables are where you store your data.\\\\n\\\\nTables are similar to excel spreadsheets.

for every row of data. A few tips for Primary Keys:\\\\n\\\\n*   It's recommended to create a Primary Key for every table in your database.\\\\n*   You can use any column as a primary key, as long as it is unique for every row.\\\\n*   It's common to use a `uuid` type or a numbered `identity` column as your primary key.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table movies (\\\\n  id bigint generated always as identity primary key\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn the example above, we have:\\\\n\\\\n1.  created a column called `id`\\\\n2.  assigned the data type `bigint`\\\\n3.  instructed the database that this should be `generated always as identity`, which means that Postgres will automatically assign a unique number to this column.\\\\n4.  Because it's unique, we can also use it as our `primary key`.\\\\n\\\\nWe could also use `generated by default as identity`, which would allow us to insert our own unique values.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table movies (\\\\n  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Loading data\\\\n\\\\nThere are several ways to load data in Supabase. You can load data directly into the database or using the [APIs](../../guides/database/api).\\\\nUse the \\\\\\\"Bulk Loading\\\\\\\" instructions if you are loading large data sets.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Basic data loading\\\\n\\\\n<Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"sql\\\\\\\" queryGroup=\\\\\\\"language\\\\\\\">\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"sql\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"SQL\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```sql\\\\n    insert into movies\\\\n      (name, description)\\\\n    values\\\\n      (\\\\n        'The Empire Strikes Back',\\\\n        'After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.'\\\\n      ),\\\\n      (\\\\n        'Return of the Jedi',\\\\n        'After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.'\\\\n      );\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"js\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"JavaScript\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```js\\\\n    const { data, error } = await supabase.from('movies').insert([\\\\n      {\\\\n        name: 'The Empire Strikes Back',\\\\n        description:\\\\n          'After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.',\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        name: 'Return of the Jedi',\\\\n        description:\\\\n          'After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.',\\\\n      },\\\\n    ])\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"dart\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Dart\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```dart\\\\n    await supabase\\\\n      .from('movies')\\\\n      .insert([{\\\\n        name: 'The Empire Strikes Back',\\\\n        description: 'After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.'\\\\n      }, {\\\\n        name: 'Return of the Jedi',\\\\n        description: 'After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.'\\\\n      }]);\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"swift\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Swift\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```swift\\\\n    try await supabase.from(\\\\\\\"movies\\\\\\\")\\\\n      .insert(\\\\n        [\\\\n          [\\\\n            \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\\\\\",\\\\n            \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\n              \\\\\\\"After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.\\\\\\\",\\\\n          ],\\\\n          [\\\\n            \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Return of the Jedi\\\\\\\",\\\\n            \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\n              \\\\\\\"After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.\\\\\\\",\\\\n          ],\\\\n        ]\\\\n      )\\\\n      .execute()\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Python\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```python\\\\n    client.from_(\\\\\\\"movies\\\\\\\").insert([\\\\n        {\\\\n            \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\\\\\",\\\\n            \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.\\\\\\\"\\\\n        },\\\\n        {\\\\n            \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Return of the Jedi\\\\\\\",\\\\n            \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.\\\\\\\"\\\\n        }\\\\n    ]).execute()\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"kotlin\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Kotlin\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```kotlin\\\\n    @Serializable\\\\n    data class Movie(\\\\n        val name: String,\\\\n        val description: String\\\\n    )\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n    ```kotlin\\\\n    supabase\\\\n        .from(\\\\\\\"movies\\\\\\\")\\\\n        .insert(listOf(\\\\n            Movie(\\\\\\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.\\\\\\\"),\\\\n            Movie(\\\\\\\"Return of the Jedi\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.\\\\\\\"),\\\\n        ))\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n</Tabs>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Bulk data loading\\\\n\\\\nWhen inserting large data sets it's best to use PostgreSQL's [COPY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) command.\\\\nThis loads data directly from a file into a table. There are several file formats available for copying data: text, CSV, binary, JSON, etc.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if you wanted to load a CSV file into your movies table:\\\\n\\\\n```text ./movies.csv\\\\n\\\\\\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\\\"Return of the Jedi\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou would [connect](../../guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections) to your database directly and load the file with the COPY command:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npsql -h DATABASE_URL -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres \\\\\\\\\\\\n  -c \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\COPY movies FROM './movies.csv';\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally use the `DELIMITER`, `HEADER` and `FORMAT` options as defined in the Postgres [COPY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) docs.\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npsql -h DATABASE_URL -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres \\\\\\\\\\\\n  -c \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\COPY movies FROM './movies.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you receive an error `FATAL:  password authentication failed for user \\\\\\\"postgres\\\\\\\"`, reset your database password in the Database Settings and try again.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Joining tables with foreign keys\\\\n\\\\nTables can be \\\\\\\"joined\\\\\\\" together using Foreign Keys.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Foreign Keys\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/database/managing-tables/joining-tables.png',\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/database/managing-tables/joining-tables--light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\nThis is where the \\\\\\\"Relational\\\\\\\" naming comes from, as data typically forms some sort of relationship.\\\\n\\\\nIn our \\\\\\\"movies\\\\\\\" example above, we might want to add a \\\\\\\"category\\\\\\\" for each movie (for example, \\\\\\\"Action\\\\\\\", or \\\\\\\"Documentary\\\\\\\").\\\\nLet's create a new table called `categories` and \\\\\\\"link\\\\\\\" our `movies` table.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table categories (\\\\n  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,\\\\n  name text -- category name\\\\n);\\\\n\\\\nalter table movies\\\\n  add column category_id bigint references categories;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can also create \\\\\\\"many-to-many\\\\\\\" relationships by creating a \\\\\\\"join\\\\\\\" table.\\\\nFor example if you had the following situations:\\\\n\\\\n*   You have a list of `movies`.\\\\n*   A movie can have several `actors`.\\\\n*   An `actor` can perform in several movies.\\\\n\\\\n<Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"dashboard\\\\\\\" queryGroup=\\\\\\\"database-method\\\\\\\">\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"dashboard\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Dashboard\\\\\\\">\\\\n    <div className=\\\\\\\"video-container\\\\\\\">\\\\n      <iframe src=\\\\\\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TKwF3IGij5c\\\\\\\" frameBorder=\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\" allow=\\\\\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\\\\\" allowFullScreen />\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"sql\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"SQL\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```sql\\\\n    create table movies (\\\\n      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,\\\\n      name text,\\\\n      description text\\\\n    );\\\\n\\\\n    create table actors (\\\\n      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,\\\\n      name text\\\\n    );\\\\n\\\\n    create table performances (\\\\n      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,\\\\n      movie_id bigint not null references movies,\\\\n      actor_id bigint not null references actors\\\\n    );\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n</Tabs>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Schemas\\\\n\\\\nTables belong to `schemas`. Schemas are a way of organizing your tables, often for security reasons.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Schemas and tables\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/database/managing-tables/schemas.png',\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/database/managing-tables/schemas--light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\nIf you don't explicitly pass a schema when creating a table, Postgres will assume that you want to create the table in the `public` schema.\\\\n\\\\nWe can create schemas for organizing tables. For example, we might want a private schema which is hidden from our API:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate schema private;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow we can create tables inside the `private` schema:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table private.salaries (\\\\n  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,\\\\n  salary bigint not null,\\\\n  actor_id bigint not null references public.actors\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Views\\\\n\\\\nA View is a convenient shortcut to a query. Creating a view does not involve new tables or data. When run, an underlying query is executed, returning its results to the user.\\\\n\\\\nSay we have the following tables from a database of a university:\\\\n\\\\n**`students`**\\\\n\\\\n{/* supa-mdx-lint-disable Rule003Spelling */}\\\\n\\\\n| id | name             | type          |\\\\n| -- | ---------------- | ------------- |\\\\n| 1  | Princess Leia    | undergraduate |\\\\n| 2  | Yoda             | graduate      |\\\\n| 3  | Anakin Skywalker | graduate      |\\\\n\\\\n{/* supa-mdx-lint-enable Rule003Spelling */}\\\\n\\\\n**`courses`**\\\\n\\\\n| id | title                    | code    |\\\\n| -- | ------------------------ | ------- |\\\\n| 1  | Introduction to Postgres | PG101   |\\\\n| 2  | Authentication Theories  | AUTH205 |\\\\n| 3  | Fundamentals of Supabase | SUP412  |\\\\n\\\\n**`grades`**\\\\n\\\\n| id | student\\\\\\\\_id | course\\\\\\\\_id | result |\\\\n| -- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |\\\\n| 1  | 1           | 1          | B+     |\\\\n| 2  | 1           | 3          | A+     |\\\\n| 3  | 2           | 2          | A      |\\\\n| 4  | 3           | 1          | A-     |\\\\n| 5  | 3           | 2          | A      |\\\\n| 6  | 3           | 3          | B-     |\\\\n\\\\nCreating a view consisting of all the three tables will look like this:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate view transcripts as\\\\n    select\\\\n        students.name,\\\\n        students.type,\\\\n        courses.title,\\\\n        courses.code,\\\\n        grades.result\\\\n    from grades\\\\n    left join students on grades.student_id = students.id\\\\n    left join courses on grades.course_id = courses.id;\\\\n\\\\ngrant all on table transcripts to authenticated;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nOnce done, we can now access the underlying query with:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect * from transcripts;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### View security\\\\n\\\\nBy default, views are accessed with their creator's permission (\\\\\\\"security definer\\\\\\\"). If a privileged role creates a view, others accessing it will use that role's elevated permissions. To enforce row level security policies, define the view with the \\\\\\\"security invoker\\\\\\\" modifier.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- alter a security_definer view to be security_invoker\\\\nalter view <view name>\\\\nset (security_invoker = true);\\\\n\\\\n-- create a view with the security_invoker modifier\\\\ncreate view <view name> with(security_invoker=true) as (\\\\n  select * from <some table>\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### When to use views\\\\n\\\\nViews provide several benefits:\\\\n\\\\n*   Simplicity\\\\n*   Consistency\\\\n*   Logical Organization\\\\n*   Security\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Simplicity\\\\n\\\\nAs a query becomes more complex, it can be a hassle to call it over and over - especially when we run it regularly. In the example above, instead of repeatedly running:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  students.name,\\\\n  students.type,\\\\n  courses.title,\\\\n  courses.code,\\\\n  grades.result\\\\nfrom\\\\n  grades\\\\n  left join students on grades.student_id = students.id\\\\n  left join courses on grades.course_id = courses.id;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe can run this instead:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect * from transcripts;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, a view behaves like a typical table. We can safely use it in table `JOIN`s or even create new views using existing views.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Consistency\\\\n\\\\nViews ensure that the likelihood of mistakes decreases when repeatedly executing a query. In our example above, we may decide that we want to exclude the course *Introduction to Postgres*. The query would become:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  students.name,\\\\n  students.type,\\\\n  courses.title,\\\\n  courses.code,\\\\n  grades.result\\\\nfrom\\\\n  grades\\\\n  left join students on grades.student_id = students.id\\\\n  left join courses on grades.course_id = courses.id\\\\nwhere courses.code != 'PG101';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWithout a view, we would need to go into every dependent query to add the new rule. This would increase in the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies, as well as introducing a lot of effort for a developer. With views, we can alter just the underlying query in the view **transcripts**. The change will be applied to all applications using this view.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Logical organization\\\\n\\\\nWith views, we can give our query a name. This is extremely useful for teams working with the same database. Instead of guessing what a query is supposed to do, a well-named view can explain it. For example, by looking at the name of the view **transcripts**, we can infer that the underlying query might involve the **students**, **courses**, and **grades** tables.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Security\\\\n\\\\nViews can restrict the amount and type of data presented to a user. Instead of allowing a user direct access to a set of tables, we provide them a view instead. We can prevent them from reading sensitive columns by excluding them from the underlying query.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Materialized views\\\\n\\\\nA [materialized view](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/rules-materializedviews.html) is a form of view but it also stores the results to disk. In subsequent reads of a materialized view, the time taken to return its results would be much faster than a conventional view. This is because the data is readily available for a materialized view while the conventional view executes the underlying query each time it is called.\\\\n\\\\nUsing our example above, a materialized view can be created like this:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate materialized view transcripts as\\\\n  select\\\\n    students.name,\\\\n    students.type,\\\\n    courses.title,\\\\n    courses.code,\\\\n    grades.result\\\\n  from\\\\n    grades\\\\n    left join students on grades.student_id = students.id\\\\n    left join courses on grades.course_id = courses.id;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nReading from the materialized view is the same as a conventional view:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect * from transcripts;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Refreshing materialized views\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, there is a trade-off - data in materialized views are not always up to date. We need to refresh it regularly to prevent the data from becoming too stale. To do so:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nrefresh materialized view transcripts;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIt's up to you how regularly refresh your materialized views, and it's probably different for each view depending on its use-case.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Materialized views vs conventional views\\\\n\\\\nMaterialized views are useful when execution times for queries or views are too slow. These could likely occur in views or queries involving multiple tables and billions of rows. When using such a view, however, there should be tolerance towards data being outdated. Some use-cases for materialized views are internal dashboards and analytics.\\\\n\\\\nCreating a materialized view is not a solution to inefficient queries. You should always seek to optimize a slow running query even if you are implementing a materialized view.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Resources\\\\n\\\\n*   [Official Docs: Create table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html)\\\\n*   [Official Docs: Create view](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html)\\\\n*   [Postgres Tutorial: Create tables](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-create-table/)\\\\n*   [Postgres Tutorial: Add column](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-add-column/)\\\\n*   [Postgres Tutorial: Views](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-views/)\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Querying Joins and Nested tables\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Querying Joins and Nested tables\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe data APIs automatically detect relationships between Postgres tables.

factors can contribute. Some of the most common causes of poor performance include:\\\\n\\\\n*   An inefficiently designed schema\\\\n*   Inefficiently designed queries\\\\n*   A lack of indexes causing slower than required queries over large tables\\\\n*   Unused indexes causing slow `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations\\\\n*   Not enough compute resources, such as memory, causing your database to go to disk for results too often\\\\n*   Lock contention from multiple queries operating on highly utilized tables\\\\n*   Large amount of bloat on your tables causing poor query planning\\\\n\\\\nYou can examine your database and queries for these issues using either the [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) or SQL.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Using the CLI\\\\n\\\\nThe Supabase CLI comes with a range of tools to help inspect your Postgres instances for potential issues. The CLI gets the information from <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/internals.html\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\">Postgres internals</a>. Therefore, most tools provided are compatible with any Postgres databases regardless if they are a Supabase project or not.\\\\n\\\\nYou can find installation instructions for the Supabase CLI <a href=\\\\\\\"/docs/guides/cli\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\">here</a>.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### The `inspect db` command\\\\n\\\\nThe inspection tools for your Postgres database are under the `inspect db` command. You can get a full list of available commands by running `supabase inspect db help`.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n$ supabase inspect db help\\\\nTools to inspect your Supabase database\\\\n\\\\nUsage:\\\\n  supabase inspect db [command]\\\\n\\\\nAvailable Commands:\\\\n  bloat                Estimates space allocated to a relation that is full of dead tuples\\\\n  blocking             Show queries that are holding locks and the queries that are waiting for them to be released\\\\n  cache-hit            Show cache hit rates for tables and indices\\\\n\\\\n...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Connect to any Postgres database\\\\n\\\\nMost inspection commands are Postgres agnostic. You can run inspection routines on any Postgres database even if it is not a Supabase project by providing a connection string via `--db-url`.\\\\n\\\\nFor example you can connect to your local Postgres instance:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nsupabase --db-url postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres inspect db bloat\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Connect to a Supabase instance\\\\n\\\\nWorking with Supabase, you can link the Supabase CLI with your project:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nsupabase link --project-ref <project-id>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen the CLI will automatically connect to your Supabase project whenever you are in the project folder and you no longer need to provide `\\u2014db-url`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Inspection commands\\\\n\\\\nBelow are the `db` inspection commands provided, grouped by different use cases.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Some commands might require `pg_stat_statements` to be enabled or a specific Postgres version to be used.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Disk storage\\\\n\\\\nThese commands are handy if you are running low on disk storage:\\\\n\\\\n*   [bloat](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-bloat) - estimates the amount of wasted space\\\\n*   [vacuum-stats](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-vacuum-stats) - gives information on waste collection routines\\\\n*   [table-record-counts](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-table-record-counts) - estimates the number of records per table\\\\n*   [table-sizes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-table-sizes) - shows the sizes of tables\\\\n*   [index-sizes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-index-sizes) - shows the sizes of individual index\\\\n*   [table-index-sizes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-table-index-sizes) - shows the sizes of indexes for each table\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Query performance\\\\n\\\\nThe commands below are useful if your Postgres database consumes a lot of resources like CPU, RAM or Disk IO. You can also use them to investigate slow queries.\\\\n\\\\n*   [cache-hit](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-cache-hit) - shows how efficient your cache usage is overall\\\\n*   [unused-indexes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-unused-indexes) - shows indexes with low index scans\\\\n*   [index-usage](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-index-usage) - shows information about the efficiency of indexes\\\\n*   [seq-scans](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-seq-scans) - show number of sequential scans recorded against all tables\\\\n*   [long-running-queries](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-long-running-queries) - shows long running queries that are executing right now\\\\n*   [outliers](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-outliers) - shows queries with high execution time but low call count and queries with high proportion of execution time spent on synchronous I/O\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Locks\\\\n\\\\n*   [locks](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-locks) - shows statements which have taken out an exclusive lock on a relation\\\\n*   [blocking](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-blocking) - shows statements that are waiting for locks to be released\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Connections\\\\n\\\\n*   [role-connections](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-role-connections) - shows number of active connections for all database roles (Supabase-specific command)\\\\n*   [replication-slots](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-replication-slots) - shows information about replication slots on the database\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Notes on `pg_stat_statements`\\\\n\\\\nFollowing commands require `pg_stat_statements` to be enabled: calls, locks, cache-hit, blocking, unused-indexes, index-usage, bloat, outliers, table-record-counts, replication-slots, seq-scans, vacuum-stats, long-running-queries.\\\\n\\\\nWhen using `pg_stat_statements` also take note that it only stores the latest 5,000 statements. Moreover, consider resetting the analysis after optimizing any queries by running `select pg_stat_statements_reset();`\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about pg\\\\\\\\_stats [here](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_stat_statements).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Using SQL\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\">\\\\n  If you're seeing an `insufficient privilege` error when viewing the Query Performance page from the dashboard, run this command:\\\\n\\\\n  ```shell\\\\n  $ grant pg_read_all_stats to postgres;\\\\n  ```\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Postgres cumulative statistics system\\\\n\\\\nPostgres collects data about its own operations using the [cumulative statistics system](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html). In addition to this, every Supabase project has the [pg\\\\\\\\_stat\\\\\\\\_statements extension](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_stat_statements) enabled by default. This extension records query execution performance details and is the best way to find inefficient queries. This information can be combined with the Postgres query plan analyzer to develop more efficient queries.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some example queries to get you started.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Most frequently called queries\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  auth.rolname,\\\\n  statements.query,\\\\n  statements.calls,\\\\n  -- -- Postgres 13, 14, 15\\\\n  statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time as total_time,\\\\n  statements.min_exec_time + statements.min_plan_time as min_time,\\\\n  statements.max_exec_time + statements.max_plan_time as max_time,\\\\n  statements.mean_exec_time + statements.mean_plan_time as mean_time,\\\\n  -- -- Postgres <= 12\\\\n  -- total_time,\\\\n  -- min_time,\\\\n  -- max_time,\\\\n  -- mean_time,\\\\n  statements.rows / statements.calls as avg_rows\\\\nfrom\\\\n  pg_stat_statements as statements\\\\n  inner join pg_authid as auth on statements.userid = auth.oid\\\\norder by statements.calls desc\\\\nlimit 100;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query shows:\\\\n\\\\n*   query statistics, ordered by the number of times each query has been executed\\\\n*   the role that ran the query\\\\n*   the number of times it has been called\\\\n*   the average number of rows returned\\\\n*   the cumulative total time the query has spent running\\\\n*   the min, max and mean query times.\\\\n\\\\nThis provides useful information about the queries you run most frequently. Queries that have high `max_time` or `mean_time` times and are being called often can be good candidates for optimization.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Slowest queries by execution time\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  auth.rolname,\\\\n  statements.query,\\\\n  statements.calls,\\\\n  -- -- Postgres 13, 14, 15\\\\n  statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time as total_time,\\\\n  statements.min_exec_time + statements.min_plan_time as min_time,\\\\n  statements.max_exec_time + statements.max_plan_time as max_time,\\\\n  statements.mean_exec_time + statements.mean_plan_time as mean_time,\\\\n  -- -- Postgres <= 12\\\\n  -- total_time,\\\\n  -- min_time,\\\\n  -- max_time,\\\\n  -- mean_time,\\\\n  statements.rows / statements.calls as avg_rows\\\\nfrom\\\\n  pg_stat_statements as statements\\\\n  inner join pg_authid as auth on statements.userid = auth.oid\\\\norder by max_time desc\\\\nlimit 100;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query will show you statistics about queries ordered by the maximum execution time. It is similar to the query above ordered by calls, but this one highlights outliers that may have high executions times. Queries which have high or mean execution times are good candidates for optimization.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Most time consuming queries\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  auth.rolname,\\\\n  statements.query,\\\\n  statements.calls,\\\\n  statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time as total_time,\\\\n  to_char(\\\\n    (\\\\n      (statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time) / sum(\\\\n        statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time\\\\n      ) over ()\\\\n    ) * 100,\\\\n    'FM90D0'\\\\n  ) || '%' as prop_total_time\\\\nfrom\\\\n  pg_stat_statements as statements\\\\n  inner join pg_authid as auth on statements.userid = auth.oid\\\\norder by total_time desc\\\\nlimit 100;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query will show you statistics about queries ordered by the cumulative total execution time. It shows the total time the query has spent running as well as the proportion of total execution time the query has taken up.\\\\n\\\\nQueries which are the most time consuming are not necessarily bad, you may have a very efficient and frequently ran queries that end up taking a large total % time, but it can be useful to help spot queries that are taking up more time than they should.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Hit rate\\\\n\\\\nGenerally for most applications a small percentage of data is accessed more regularly than the rest. To make sure that your regularly accessed data is available, Postgres tracks your data access patterns and keeps this in its [shared\\\\\\\\_buffers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-MEMORY) cache.\\\\n\\\\nApplications with lower cache hit rates generally perform more poorly since they have to hit the disk to get results rather than serving them from memory. Very poor hit rates can also cause you to burst past your [Disk IO limits](./compute-add-ons#disk-io) causing significant performance issues.\\\\n\\\\nYou can view your cache and index hit rate by executing the following query:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  'index hit rate' as name,\\\\n  (sum(idx_blks_hit)) / nullif(sum(idx_blks_hit + idx_blks_read), 0) * 100 as ratio\\\\nfrom pg_statio_user_indexes\\\\nunion all\\\\nselect\\\\n  'table hit rate' as name,\\\\n  sum(heap_blks_hit) / nullif(sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read), 0) * 100 as ratio\\\\nfrom pg_statio_user_tables;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis shows the ratio of data blocks fetched from the Postgres [shared\\\\\\\\_buffers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-MEMORY) cache against the data blocks that were read from disk/OS cache.\\\\n\\\\nIf either of your index or table hit rate are \\\\\\\\< 99% then this can indicate your compute plan is too small for your current workload and you would benefit from more memory. [Upgrading your compute](./compute-add-ons) is easy and can be done from your [project dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/settings/compute-and-disk).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Optimizing poor performing queries\\\\n\\\\nPostgres has built in tooling to help you optimize poorly performing queries. You can use the [query plan analyzer](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) on any expensive queries that you have identified:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nexplain analyze <query-statement-here>;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhen you include `analyze` in the explain statement, the database attempts to execute the query and provides a detailed query plan along with actual execution times. So, be careful using `explain analyze` with `insert`/`update`/`delete` queries, because the query will actually run, and could have unintended side-effects.\\\\n\\\\nIf you run just `explain` without the `analyze` keyword, the database will only perform query planning without actually executing the query. This approach can be beneficial when you want to inspect the query plan without affecting the database or if you encounter timeouts in your queries.\\\\n\\\\nUsing the query plan analyzer to optimize your queries is a large topic, with a number of online resources available:\\\\n\\\\n*   [Official docs.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html)\\\\n    {/* supa-mdx-lint-disable-next-line Rule004ExcludeWords */}\\\\n*   [The Art of PostgreSQL.](https://theartofpostgresql.com/explain-plan-visualizer/)\\\\n*   [Postgres Wiki.](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Using_EXPLAIN)\\\\n*   [Enterprise DB.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/postgresql-query-optimization-performance-tuning-with-explain-analyze)\\\\n\\\\nYou can pair the information available from `pg_stat_statements` with the detailed system metrics available [via your metrics endpoint](../platform/metrics) to better understand the behavior of your DB and the queries you're executing against it.\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Vector search with Next.js and OpenAI\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Vector search with Next.js and OpenAI\\\\n\\\\nLearn how to build a ChatGPT-style doc search powered by Next.js, OpenAI, and Supabase.\\\\n\\\\nWhile our [Headless Vector search](/docs/guides/ai/examples/headless-vector-search) provides a toolkit for generative Q\\\\\\\\&A, in this tutorial we'll go more in-depth, build a custom ChatGPT-like search experience from the ground-up using Next.js.

The SQL included in this guide is applicable for clients in all programming languages. If you are a Python user see your [Python client options](/docs/guides/ai/python-clients) after reading the `Learn` section.\\\\n\\\\nVectors in Supabase are enabled via [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/), a Postgres extension for storing and querying vectors in Postgres. It can be used to store [embeddings](/docs/guides/ai/concepts#what-are-embeddings).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Enable the extension\\\\n\\\\n<Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"dashboard\\\\\\\" queryGroup=\\\\\\\"database-method\\\\\\\">\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"dashboard\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Dashboard\\\\\\\">\\\\n    1.  Go to the [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.\\\\n    2.  Click on **Extensions** in the sidebar.\\\\n    3.  Search for \\\\\\\"vector\\\\\\\" and enable the extension.\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"sql\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"SQL\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```sql\\\\n     -- Example: enable the \\\\\\\"vector\\\\\\\" extension.\\\\n    create extension vector\\\\n    with\\\\n      schema extensions;\\\\n\\\\n    -- Example: disable the \\\\\\\"vector\\\\\\\" extension\\\\n    drop\\\\n      extension if exists vector;\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n    Even though the SQL code is `create extension`, this is the equivalent of \\\\\\\"enabling the extension\\\\\\\".\\\\n    To disable an extension, call `drop extension`.\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n</Tabs>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Create a table to store vectors\\\\n\\\\nAfter enabling the `vector` extension, you will get access to a new data type called `vector`. The size of the vector (indicated in parenthesis) represents the number of dimensions stored in that vector.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table documents (\\\\n  id serial primary key,\\\\n  title text not null,\\\\n  body text not null,\\\\n  embedding extensions.vector(384)\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn the above SQL snippet, we create a `documents` table with a column called `embedding` (note this is just a regular Postgres column - you can name it whatever you like). We give the `embedding` column a `vector` data type with 384 dimensions. Change this to the number of dimensions produced by your embedding model. For example, if you are [generating embeddings](/docs/guides/ai/quickstarts/generate-text-embeddings) using the open source [`gte-small`](https://huggingface.co/Supabase/gte-small) model, you would set this number to 384 since that model produces 384 dimensions.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"tip\\\\\\\">\\\\n  In general, embeddings with fewer dimensions perform best. See our [analysis on fewer dimensions in pgvector](/blog/fewer-dimensions-are-better-pgvector).\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Storing a vector / embedding\\\\n\\\\nIn this example we'll generate a vector using Transformers.js, then store it in the database using the Supabase JavaScript client.\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport { pipeline } from '@xenova/transformers'\\\\nconst generateEmbedding = await pipeline('feature-extraction', 'Supabase/gte-small')\\\\n\\\\nconst title = 'First post!'\\\\nconst body = 'Hello world!'\\\\n\\\\n// Generate a vector using Transformers.js\\\\nconst output = await generateEmbedding(body, {\\\\n  pooling: 'mean',\\\\n  normalize: true,\\\\n})\\\\n\\\\n// Extract the embedding output\\\\nconst embedding = Array.from(output.data)\\\\n\\\\n// Store the vector in Postgres\\\\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.from('documents').insert({\\\\n  title,\\\\n  body,\\\\n  embedding,\\\\n})\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis example uses the JavaScript Supabase client, but you can modify it to work with any [supported language library](/docs#client-libraries).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Querying a vector / embedding\\\\n\\\\nSimilarity search is the most common use case for vectors. `pgvector` support 3 new operators for computing distance:\\\\n\\\\n| Operator | Description            |\\\\n| -------- | ---------------------- |\\\\n| `<->`    | Euclidean distance     |\\\\n| `<#>`    | negative inner product |\\\\n| `<=>`    | cosine distance        |\\\\n\\\\nChoosing the right operator depends on your needs. Dot product tends to be the fastest if your vectors are normalized. For more information on how embeddings work and how they relate to each other, see [What are Embeddings?](/docs/guides/ai/concepts#what-are-embeddings).\\\\n\\\\nSupabase client libraries like `supabase-js` connect to your Postgres instance via [PostgREST](/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture#postgrest-api). PostgREST does not currently support `pgvector` similarity operators, so we'll need to wrap our query in a Postgres function and call it via the `rpc()` method:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate or replace function match_documents (\\\\n  query_embedding extensions.vector(384),\\\\n  match_threshold float,\\\\n  match_count int\\\\n)\\\\nreturns table (\\\\n  id bigint,\\\\n  title text,\\\\n  body text,\\\\n  similarity float\\\\n)\\\\nlanguage sql stable\\\\nas $$\\\\n  select\\\\n    documents.id,\\\\n    documents.title,\\\\n    documents.body,\\\\n    1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity\\\\n  from documents\\\\n  where 1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) > match_threshold\\\\n  order by (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) asc\\\\n  limit match_count;\\\\n$$;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis function takes a `query_embedding` argument and compares it to all other embeddings in the `documents` table. Each comparison returns a similarity score. If the similarity is greater than the `match_threshold` argument, it is returned. The number of rows returned is limited by the `match_count` argument.\\\\n\\\\nFeel free to modify this method to fit the needs of your application. The `match_threshold` ensures that only documents that have a minimum similarity to the `query_embedding` are returned. Without this, you may end up returning documents that subjectively don't match. This value will vary for each application - you will need to perform your own testing to determine the threshold that makes sense for your app.\\\\n\\\\nIf you index your vector column, ensure that the `order by` sorts by the distance function directly (rather than sorting by the calculated `similarity` column, which may lead to the index being ignored and poor performance).\\\\n\\\\nTo execute the function from your client library, call `rpc()` with the name of your Postgres function:\\\\n\\\\n```ts\\\\nconst { data: documents } = await supabaseClient.rpc('match_documents', {\\\\n  query_embedding: embedding, // Pass the embedding you want to compare\\\\n  match_threshold: 0.78, // Choose an appropriate threshold for your data\\\\n  match_count: 10, // Choose the number of matches\\\\n})\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this example `embedding` would be another embedding you wish to compare against your table of pre-generated embedding documents. For example if you were building a search engine, every time the user submits their query you would first generate an embedding on the search query itself, then pass it into the above `rpc()` function to match.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"tip\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Be sure to use embeddings produced from the same embedding model when calculating distance. Comparing embeddings from two different models will produce no meaningful result.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\nVectors and embeddings can be used for much more than search.

Aligning indexes with common query patterns can speed up data retrieval by an order of magnitude.\\\\n\\\\nThis guide is intended to:\\\\n\\\\n*   help identify parts of a query that have the potential to be improved by indexes\\\\n*   introduce tooling to help identify useful indexes\\\\n\\\\nThis is not a comprehensive resource, but rather a helpful starting point for your optimization journey.\\\\n\\\\nIf you're new to query optimization, you may be interested in [`index_advisor`](/docs/guides/database/extensions/index_advisor), our tool for automatically detecting indexes that improve performance on a given query.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Example query\\\\n\\\\nConsider the following example query that retrieves customer names and purchase dates from two tables:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  a.name,\\\\n  b.date_of_purchase\\\\nfrom\\\\n  customers as a\\\\n  join orders as b on a.id = b.customer_id\\\\nwhere a.sign_up_date > '2023-01-01' and b.status = 'shipped'\\\\norder by b.date_of_purchase\\\\nlimit 10;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this query, there are several parts that indexes could likely help in optimizing the performance:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### `where` clause:\\\\n\\\\nThe `where` clause filters rows based on certain conditions, and indexing the columns involved can improve this process:\\\\n\\\\n*   `a.sign_up_date`: If filtering by `sign_up_date` is common, indexing this column can speed up the query.\\\\n*   `b.status`: Indexing the status may be beneficial if the column has diverse values.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_customers_sign_up_date on customers (sign_up_date);\\\\n\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_status on orders (status);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### `join` columns\\\\n\\\\nIndexes on the columns used for joining tables can help Postgres avoid scanning tables in their entirety when connecting tables.\\\\n\\\\n*   Indexing `a.id` and `b.customer_id` would likely improve the performance of the join in this query.\\\\n*   Note that if `a.id` is the primary key of the `customers` table it is already indexed\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_customer_id on orders (customer_id);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### `order by` clause\\\\n\\\\nSorting can also be optimized by indexing:\\\\n\\\\n*   An index on `b.date_of_purchase` can improve the sorting process, and is particularly beneficial when a subset of rows is being returned with a `limit` clause.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_date_of_purchase on orders (date_of_purchase);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Key concepts\\\\n\\\\nHere are some concepts and tools to keep in mind to help you identify the best index for the job, and measure the impact that your index had:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Analyze the query plan\\\\n\\\\nUse the `explain` command to understand the query's execution. Look for slow parts, such as Sequential Scans or high cost numbers. If creating an index does not reduce the cost of the query plan, remove it.\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nexplain select * from customers where sign_up_date > 25;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Use appropriate index types\\\\n\\\\nPostgres offers various index types like [B-tree, Hash, GIN, etc](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html). Select the type that best suits your data and query pattern. Using the right index type can make a significant difference. For example, using a BRIN index on a field that always increases and lives within a table that updates infrequently - like `created_at` on an `orders` table - routinely results in indexes that are +10x smaller than the equivalent default B-tree index. That translates into better scalability.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_created_at ON customers using brin(created_at);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Partial indexes\\\\n\\\\nFor queries that frequently target a subset of data, a partial index could be faster and smaller than indexing the entire column. A partial index contains a `where` clause to filter the values included in the index. Note that a query's `where` clause must match the index for it to be used.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_status on orders (status)\\\\nwhere status = 'shipped';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Composite indexes\\\\n\\\\nIf filtering or joining on multiple columns, a composite index prevents Postgres from referring to multiple indexes when identifying the relevant rows.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_customers_sign_up_date_priority on customers (sign_up_date, priority);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Over-Indexing\\\\n\\\\nAvoid the urge to index columns you operate on infrequently. While indexes can speed up reads, they also slow down writes, so it's important to balance those factors when making indexing decisions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Statistics\\\\n\\\\nPostgres maintains a set of statistics about the contents of your tables. Those statistics are used by the query planner to decide when it's is more efficient to use an index vs scanning the entire table. If the collected statistics drift too far from reality, the query planner may make poor decisions. To avoid this risk, you can periodically `analyze` tables.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nanalyze customers;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\\nBy following this guide, you'll be able to discern where indexes can optimize queries and enhance your Postgres performance. Remember that each database is unique, so always consider the specific context and use case of your queries.\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Error Codes\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Error

For example, if a user searches for \\\\\\\"Italian recipes with tomato sauce\\\\\\\" on a cooking app, a keyword search would pull up recipes that specifically mention \\\\\\\"Italian,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"recipes,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"tomato sauce\\\\\\\" in the text. However, it might miss out on dishes that are quintessentially Italian and use tomato sauce but don't explicitly label themselves with these words, or use variations like \\\\\\\"pasta sauce\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"marinara.\\\\\\\" On the other hand, a semantic search might understand the culinary context and find recipes that match the intent, such as a traditional \\\\\\\"Spaghetti Marinara,\\\\\\\" even if they don't match the exact keyword phrase. However, it could also suggest recipes that are contextually related but not what the user is looking for, like a \\\\\\\"Mexican salsa\\\\\\\" recipe, because it understands the context to be broadly about tomato-based sauces.\\\\n\\\\nHybrid search combines the strengths of both these methods. It would ensure that recipes explicitly mentioning the keywords are prioritized, thus capturing direct hits that satisfy the keyword criteria. At the same time, it would include recipes identified through semantic understanding as being related in meaning or context, like different Italian dishes that traditionally use tomato sauce but might not have been tagged explicitly with the user's search terms. It identifies results that are both directly and contextually relevant to the user's query while ideally minimizing misses and irrelevant suggestions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## When to consider hybrid search\\\\n\\\\nThe decision to use hybrid search depends on what your users are looking for in your app. For a code repository where developers need to find exact lines of code or error messages, keyword search is likely ideal because it matches specific terms. In a mental health forum where users search for advice or experiences related to their feelings, semantic search may be better because it finds results based on the meaning of a query, not just specific words. For a shopping app where customers might search for specific product names yet also be open to related suggestions, hybrid search combines the best of both worlds - finding exact matches while also uncovering similar products based on the shopping context.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## How to combine search methods\\\\n\\\\nHybrid search merges keyword search and semantic search, but how does this process work?\\\\n\\\\nFirst, each search method is executed separately. Keyword search, which involves searching by specific words or phrases present in the content, will yield its own set of results. Similarly, semantic search, which involves understanding the context or meaning behind the search query rather than the specific words used, will generate its own unique results.\\\\n\\\\nNow with these separate result lists available, the next step is to combine them into a single, unified list. This is achieved through a process known as \\u201cfusion\\u201d. Fusion takes the results from both search methods and merges them together based on a certain ranking or scoring system. This system may prioritize certain results based on factors like their relevance to the search query, their ranking in the individual lists, or other criteria. The result is a final list that integrates the strengths of both keyword and semantic search methods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Reciprocal Ranked Fusion (RRF)\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most common fusion methods is Reciprocal Ranked Fusion (RRF). The key idea behind RRF is to give more weight to the top-ranked items in each individual result list when building the final combined list.\\\\n\\\\nIn RRF, we iterate over each record and assign a score (noting that each record could exist in one or both lists). The score is calculated as 1 divided by that record's rank in each list, summed together between both lists. For example, if a record with an ID of `123` was ranked third in the keyword search and ninth in semantic search, it would receive a score of $$\\\\\\\\dfrac{1}{3} + \\\\\\\\dfrac{1}{9} = 0.444$$. If the record was found in only one list and not the other, it would receive a score of 0 for the other list. The records are then sorted by this score to create the final list. The items with the highest scores are ranked first, and lowest scores ranked last.\\\\n\\\\nThis method ensures that items that are ranked high in multiple lists are given a high rank in the final list. It also ensures that items that are ranked high in only a few lists but low in others are not given a high rank in the final list. Placing the rank in the denominator when calculating score helps penalize the low ranking records.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Smoothing constant `k`\\\\n\\\\nTo prevent extremely high scores for items that are ranked first (since we're dividing by the rank), a `k` constant is often added to the denominator to smooth the score:\\\\n\\\\n$$\\\\\\\\dfrac{1}{k+rank}$$\\\\n\\\\nThis constant can be any positive number, but is typically small. A constant of 1 would mean that a record ranked first would have a score of $$\\\\\\\\dfrac{1}{1+1} = 0.5$$ instead of $$1$$. This adjustment can help balance the influence of items that are ranked very high in individual lists when creating the final combined list.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Hybrid search in Postgres\\\\n\\\\nLet's implement hybrid search in Postgres using `tsvector` (keyword search) and `pgvector` (semantic search).\\\\n\\\\nFirst we'll create a `documents` table to store the documents that we will search over. This is just an example - adjust this to match the structure of your application.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table documents (\\\\n  id bigint primary key generated always as identity,\\\\n  content text,\\\\n  fts tsvector generated always as (to_tsvector('english', content)) stored,\\\\n  embedding extensions.vector(512)\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe table contains 4 columns:\\\\n\\\\n*   `id` is an auto-generated unique ID for the record. We'll use this later to match records when performing RRF.\\\\n*   `content` contains the actual text we will be searching over.\\\\n*   `fts` is an auto-generated `tsvector` column that is generated using the text in `content`. We will use this for [full text search](/docs/guides/database/full-text-search) (search by keyword).\\\\n*   `embedding` is a [vector column](/docs/guides/ai/vector-columns) that stores the vector generated from our embedding model. We will use this for [semantic search](/docs/guides/ai/semantic-search) (search by meaning). We chose 512 dimensions for this example, but adjust this to match the size of the embedding vectors generated from your preferred model.\\\\n\\\\nNext we'll create indexes on the `fts` and `embedding` columns so that their individual queries will remain fast at scale:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Create an index for the full-text search\\\\ncreate index on documents using gin(fts);\\\\n\\\\n-- Create an index for the semantic vector search\\\\ncreate index on documents using hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor full text search we use a [generalized inverted (GIN) index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin.html) which is designed for handling composite values like those stored in a `tsvector`.\\\\n\\\\nFor semantic vector search we use an [HNSW index](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes/hnsw-indexes), which is a high performing approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithm. Note that we are using the `vector_ip_ops` (inner product) operator with this index because we plan on using the inner product (`<#>`) operator later in our query. If you plan to use a different operator like cosine distance (`<=>`), be sure to update the index accordingly. For more information, see [distance operators](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes#distance-operators).\\\\n\\\\nFinally we'll create our `hybrid_search` function:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate or replace function hybrid_search(\\\\n  query_text text,\\\\n  query_embedding extensions.vector(512),\\\\n  match_count int,\\\\n  full_text_weight float = 1,\\\\n  semantic_weight float = 1,\\\\n  rrf_k int = 50\\\\n)\\\\nreturns setof documents\\\\nlanguage sql\\\\nas $$\\\\nwith full_text as (\\\\n  select\\\\n    id,\\\\n    -- Note: ts_rank_cd is not indexable but will only rank matches of the where clause\\\\n    -- which shouldn't be too big\\\\n    row_number() over(order by ts_rank_cd(fts, websearch_to_tsquery(query_text)) desc) as rank_ix\\\\n  from\\\\n    documents\\\\n  where\\\\n    fts @@ websearch_to_tsquery(query_text)\\\\n  order by rank_ix\\\\n  limit least(match_count, 30) * 2\\\\n),\\\\nsemantic as (\\\\n  select\\\\n    id,\\\\n    row_number() over (order by embedding <#> query_embedding) as rank_ix\\\\n  from\\\\n    documents\\\\n  order by rank_ix\\\\n  limit least(match_count, 30) * 2\\\\n)\\\\nselect\\\\n  documents.*\\\\nfrom\\\\n  full_text\\\\n  full outer join semantic\\\\n    on full_text.id = semantic.id\\\\n  join documents\\\\n    on coalesce(full_text.id, semantic.id) = documents.id\\\\norder by\\\\n  coalesce(1.0 / (rrf_k + full_text.rank_ix), 0.0) * full_text_weight +\\\\n  coalesce(1.0 / (rrf_k + semantic.rank_ix), 0.0) * semantic_weight\\\\n  desc\\\\nlimit\\\\n  least(match_count, 30)\\\\n$$;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nLet's break this down:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Parameters:** The function accepts quite a few parameters, but the main (required) ones are `query_text`, `query_embedding`, and `match_count`.\\\\n\\\\n    *   `query_text` is the user's query text (more on this shortly)\\\\n    *   `query_embedding` is the vector representation of the user's query produced by the embedding model. We chose 512 dimensions for this example, but adjust this to match the size of the embedding vectors generated from your preferred model. This must match the size of the `embedding` vector on the `documents` table (and use the same model).\\\\n    *   `match_count` is the number of records returned in the `limit` clause.\\\\n\\\\n    The other parameters are optional, but give more control over the fusion process.\\\\n\\\\n    *   `full_text_weight` and `semantic_weight` decide how much weight each search method gets in the final score. These are both 1 by default which means they both equally contribute towards the final rank. A `full_text_weight` of 2 and `semantic_weight` of 1 would give full-text search twice as much weight as semantic search.\\\\n    *   `rrf_k` is the `k` [smoothing constant](#smoothing-constant-k) added to the reciprocal rank. The default is 50.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Return type:** The function returns a set of records from our `documents` table.\\\\n\\\\n*   **CTE:** We create two [common table expressions (CTE)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html), one for full-text search and one for semantic search. These perform each query individually prior to joining them.\\\\n\\\\n*   **RRF:** The final query combines the results from the two CTEs using [reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)](#reciprocal-ranked-fusion-rrf).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Running hybrid search\\\\n\\\\nTo use this function in SQL, we can run:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  *\\\\nfrom\\\\n  hybrid_search(\\\\n    'Italian recipes with tomato sauce', -- user query\\\\n    '[...]'::extensions.vector(512), -- embedding generated from user query\\\\n    10\\\\n  );\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn practice, you will likely be calling this from the [Supabase client](/docs/reference/javascript/introduction) or through a custom backend layer. Here is a quick example of how you might call this from an [Edge Function](/docs/guides/functions) using JavaScript:\\\\n\\\\n```tsx\\\\nimport { createClient } from 'npm:@supabase/supabase-js@2'\\\\nimport OpenAI from 'npm:openai'\\\\n\\\\nconst supabaseUrl = Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!\\\\nconst supabaseServiceRoleKey = Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')!\\\\nconst openaiApiKey = Deno.env.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')!\\\\n\\\\nDeno.serve(async (req) => {\\\\n  // Grab the user's query from the JSON payload\\\\n  const { query } = await req.json()\\\\n\\\\n  // Instantiate OpenAI client\\\\n  const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: openaiApiKey })\\\\n\\\\n  // Generate a one-time embedding for the user's query\\\\n  const embeddingResponse = await openai.embeddings.create({\\\\n    model: 'text-embedding-3-large',\\\\n    input: query,\\\\n    dimensions: 512,\\\\n  })\\\\n\\\\n  const [{ embedding }] = embeddingResponse.data\\\\n\\\\n  // Instantiate the Supabase client\\\\n  // (replace service role key with user's JWT if using Supabase auth and RLS)\\\\n  const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceRoleKey)\\\\n\\\\n  // Call hybrid_search Postgres function via RPC\\\\n  const { data: documents } = await supabase.rpc('hybrid_search', {\\\\n    query_text: query,\\\\n    query_embedding: embedding,\\\\n    match_count: 10,\\\\n  })\\\\n\\\\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify(documents), {\\\\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\\\\n  })\\\\n})\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model to generate embeddings (shortened to 512 dimensions for faster retrieval). Swap in your preferred embedding model (and dimension size) accordingly.\\\\n\\\\nTo test this, make a `POST` request to the function's endpoint while passing in a JSON payload containing the user's query. Here is an example `POST` request using cURL:\\\\n\\\\n```tsx\\\\ncurl -i --location --request POST \\\\\\\\\\\\n  'http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/hybrid-search' \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <anonymous key>' \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --data '{\\\\\\\"query\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Italian recipes with tomato sauce\\\\\\\"}'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor more information on how to create, test, and deploy edge functions, see [Getting started](/docs/guides/functions/quickstart).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## See also\\\\n\\\\n*   [Embedding concepts](/docs/guides/ai/concepts)\\\\n*   [Vector columns](/docs/guides/ai/vector-columns)\\\\n*   [Vector indexes](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes)\\\\n*   [Semantic search](/docs/guides/ai/semantic-search)\\\\n*   [Full text (keyword) search](/docs/guides/database/full-text-search)\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Interpreting Supabase Grafana IO charts\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Interpreting Supabase Grafana IO charts\\\\n\\\\n> [Supabase Grafana Installation Guide](/docs/guides/platform/metrics#deploying-supabase-grafana)\\\\n\\\\nThere are two primary values that matter for IO:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Disk Throughput**: how much data can be moved to and from disk per second\\\\n*   **IOPS(Input/Output per second)**: how many read/write requests can be performed against your disk per second\\\\n\\\\nEach compute instance has unique IO settings. The current baseline (sustained) and max (burst) limits are listed below.\\\\n\\\\nCompute sizes below XL can burst above baseline for short periods before returning back to their baseline behavior.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other metrics that indicate IO strain.\\\\n\\\\nThis example shows a 16XL database exhibiting severe IO strain:\\\\n\\\\n![image](/docs/img/troubleshooting/9c6e0f9c-f842-463b-b214-1a9e31de3b2c.png)\\\\n\\\\nIts Disk IOPS is constantly near peak capacity:\\\\n\\\\n![image](/docs/img/troubleshooting/ec5ed538-985b-411d-a0d7-be718b28d367.png)\\\\n\\\\nIts throughput is also high:\\\\n\\\\n![image](/docs/img/troubleshooting/90cb6a70-fc67-4666-9217-6fa37cfacf82.png)\\\\n\\\\nAs a side-effect, its CPU is encumbered by heavy Busy IOWait activity:\\\\n\\\\n![image](/docs/img/troubleshooting/9b88a738-65d6-4be4-8fa0-bc3f13a9a408.png)\\\\n\\\\nExcessive IO usage is highly problematic as it clarifies that your database is expending more IO than it normally is intended to manage. This can be caused by\\\\n\\\\n*   **Excessive and needless sequential scans:** poorly indexed tables force requests to scan disk ([guide to resolve](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/22449))\\\\n*   **Too little cache**: There is not enough memory, so instead of reading data from the memory cache, it is accessed from disk ([guide to inspect](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/22449))\\\\n*   **Poorly optimized RLS policies**: RLS that rely heavily on joins are more likely to hit disk. If possible, they should optimized ([RLS best practice guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#rls-performance-recommendations))\\\\n*   **Excessive bloat**: This is the least likely to cause major issues, but bloat can take up space, preventing data on disk from being placed in the same locality. This can force the database to scan more pages than necessary. ([explainer guide](/blog/postgres-bloat))\\\\n*   **Uploading high amounts of data:** temporarily increase compute add-on size for the duration of the uploads\\\\n*   **Insufficient memory**: Sometimes an inadequate amount of memory forces queries to hit disk instead of the memory cache. Address memory issues ([guide](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27021)) can reduce disk strain.\\\\n\\\\nIf a database exhibited some of these metrics for prolonged periods, then there are a few primary approaches:\\\\n\\\\n*   Scale the database to get more IO if possible\\\\n*   Optimize queries/tables or refactor database/app to reduce IO\\\\n*   Spin-up a [read-replica](/dashboard/project/_/settings/infrastructure)\\\\n*   Modify IO configs in the [Compute and Disk settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/compute-and-disk)\\\\n*   [Partitions](/docs/guides/database/partitions): Generally should be used on very large tables to minimize data pulled from disk\\\\n\\\\nOther useful Supabase Grafana guides:\\\\n\\\\n*   [Connections](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27141)\\\\n*   [Memory](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27021)\\\\n*   [CPU](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27022)\\\\n\\\\n### Esoteric factors\\\\n\\\\n**Webhooks**:\\\\nSupabase webhooks use the pg\\\\\\\\_net extension to handle requests. The `net.http_request_queue` table isn't indexed to keep write costs low. However, if you upload millions of rows to a webhook-enabled table too quickly, it can significantly increase the read costs for the extension.\\\\n\\\\nTo check if reads are becoming expensive, run:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect count(*) as exact_count from net.http_request_queue;\\\\n-- the number should be relatively low <20,000\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you encounter this issue, you can either:\\\\n\\\\n1.  Increase your compute size to help handle the large volume of requests.\\\\n\\\\n2.  Truncate the table to clear the queue:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nTRUNCATE net.http_request_queue;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Partitioning tables\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Partitioning tables\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTable partitioning is a technique that allows you to divide a large table into smaller, more manageable parts called \\u201cpartitions\\u201d.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"multi database\\\\\\\"\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/database/partitions-light.png',\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/database/partitions-dark.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n  className=\\\\\\\"max-h-[400px] !mx-auto\\\\\\\"\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\nEach partition contains a subset of the data based on a specified criteria, such as a range of values or a specific condition. Partitioning can significantly improve query performance and simplify data management for large datasets.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Benefits of table partitioning\\\\n\\\\n*   **Improved query performance:** allows queries to target specific partitions, reducing the amount of data scanned and improving query execution time.\\\\n*   **Scalability:** With partitioning, you can add or remove partitions as your data grows or changes, enabling better scalability and flexibility.\\\\n*   **Efficient data management:** simplifies tasks such as data loading, archiving, and deletion by operating on smaller partitions instead of the entire table.\\\\n*   **Enhanced maintenance operations:** can optimize vacuuming and indexing, leading to faster maintenance tasks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Partitioning methods\\\\n\\\\nPostgres supports various partitioning methods based on how you want to partition your data. The commonly used methods are:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Range Partitioning**: Data is divided into partitions based on a specified range of values. For example, you can partition a sales table by date, where each partition represents a specific time range (e.g., one partition for each month).\\\\n2.  **List Partitioning**: Data is divided into partitions based on a specified list of values. For instance, you can partition a customer table by region, where each partition contains customers from a specific region (e.g., one partition for customers in the US, another for customers in Europe).\\\\n3.  **Hash Partitioning**: Data is distributed across partitions using a hash function. This method provides a way to evenly distribute data among partitions, which can be useful for load balancing. However, it doesn't allow direct querying based on specific values.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Creating partitioned tables\\\\n\\\\nLet's consider an example of range partitioning for a sales table based on the order date. We'll create monthly partitions to store data for each month:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table sales (\\\\n    id bigint generated by default as identity,\\\\n    order_date date not null,\\\\n    customer_id bigint,\\\\n    amount bigint,\\\\n\\\\n    -- We need to include all the\\\\n    -- partitioning columns in constraints:\\\\n    primary key (order_date, id)\\\\n)\\\\npartition by range (order_date);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table sales_2000_01\\\\n\\\\tpartition of sales\\\\n  for values from ('2000-01-01') to ('2000-02-01');\\\\n\\\\ncreate table sales_2000_02\\\\n\\\\tpartition of sales\\\\n\\\\tfor values from ('2000-02-01') to ('2000-03-01');\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTo create a partitioned table you append `partition by range (<column_name>)` to the table creation statement. The column that you are partitioning with *must* be included in any unique index, which is the reason why we specify a composite primary key here (`primary key (order_date, id)`).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Querying partitioned tables\\\\n\\\\nTo query a partitioned table, you have two options:\\\\n\\\\n1.  Querying the parent table\\\\n2.  Querying specific partitions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Querying the parent table\\\\n\\\\nWhen you query the parent table, Postgres automatically routes the query to the relevant partitions based on the conditions specified in the query. This allows you to retrieve data from all partitions simultaneously.\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect *\\\\nfrom sales\\\\nwhere order_date >= '2000-01-01' and order_date < '2000-03-01';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query will retrieve data from both the `sales_2000_01` and `sales_2000_02` partitions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Querying specific partitions\\\\n\\\\nIf you only need to retrieve data from a specific partition, you can directly query that partition instead of the parent table. This approach is useful when you want to target a specific range or condition within a partition.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect *\\\\nfrom sales_2000_02;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query will retrieve data only from the `sales_2000_02` partition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## When to partition your tables\\\\n\\\\nThere is no real threshold to determine when you should use partitions. Partitions introduce complexity, and complexity should be avoided until it's needed. A few guidelines:\\\\n\\\\n*   If you are considering performance, avoid partitions until you see performance degradation on non-partitioned tables.\\\\n*   If you are using partitions as a management tool, it's fine to create the partitions any time.\\\\n*   If you don't know how you should partition your data, then it's probably too early.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Examples\\\\n\\\\nHere are simple examples for each of the partitioning types in Postgres.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Range partitioning\\\\n\\\\nLet's consider a range partitioning example for a table that stores sales data based on the order date. We'll create monthly partitions to store data for each month.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, the **`sales`** table is partitioned into two partitions: **`sales_january`** and **`sales_february`**. The data in these partitions is based on the specified range of order dates:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table sales (\\\\n    id bigint generated by default as identity,\\\\n    order_date date not null,\\\\n    customer_id bigint,\\\\n    amount bigint,\\\\n\\\\n    -- We need to include all the\\\\n    -- partitioning columns in constraints:\\\\n    primary key (order_date, id)\\\\n)\\\\npartition by range (order_date);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table sales_2000_01\\\\n\\\\tpartition of sales\\\\n  for values from ('2000-01-01') to ('2000-02-01');\\\\n\\\\ncreate table sales_2000_02\\\\n\\\\tpartition of sales\\\\n\\\\tfor values from ('2000-02-01') to ('2000-03-01');\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### List partitioning\\\\n\\\\nLet's consider a list partitioning example for a table that stores customer data based on their region. We'll create partitions to store customers from different regions.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, the **`customers`** table is partitioned into two partitions: `customers_americas` and `customers_asia`. The data in these partitions is based on the specified list of regions:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Create the partitioned table\\\\ncreate table customers (\\\\n    id bigint generated by default as identity,\\\\n    name text,\\\\n    country text,\\\\n\\\\n    -- We need to include all the\\\\n    -- partitioning columns in constraints:\\\\n    primary key (country, id)\\\\n)\\\\npartition by list(country);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table customers_americas\\\\n\\\\tpartition of customers\\\\n\\\\tfor values in ('US', 'CANADA');\\\\n\\\\ncreate table customers_asia\\\\n\\\\tpartition of customers\\\\n  for values in ('INDIA', 'CHINA', 'JAPAN');\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Hash partitioning\\\\n\\\\nYou can use hash partitioning to evenly distribute data.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, the **`products`** table is partitioned into two partitions: `products_one` and `products_two`. The data is distributed across these partitions using a hash function:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table products (\\\\n    id bigint generated by default as identity,\\\\n    name text,\\\\n    category text,\\\\n    price bigint\\\\n)\\\\npartition by hash (id);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table products_one\\\\n\\\\tpartition of products\\\\n  for values with (modulus 2, remainder 1);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table products_two\\\\n\\\\tpartition of products\\\\n  for values with (modulus 2, remainder 0);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Other tools\\\\n\\\\nThere are several other tools available for Postgres partitioning, most notably [pg\\\\\\\\_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman).

This can be done by adding the following filter to your queries:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n...query\\\\nwhere\\\\n  -- Excluding routine events related to cron, PgBouncer, checkpoints, and successful connections\\\\n  not regexp_contains(event_message, '^cron|PgBouncer|checkpoint|connection received|authenticated|authorized';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### By timeframe\\\\n\\\\nTo investigate issues around a specific period:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- filtering by time period\\\\n...query\\\\nwhere\\\\n  timestamp between '2024-05-06 04:44:00' and '2024-05-06 04:45:00'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### By error severity\\\\n\\\\nThis filter finds all errors, fatals, and panics:\\\\n\\\\n| Severity | Usage                                                        |\\\\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\\\\n| ERROR    | Reports an error that caused the current command to abort.   |\\\\n| FATAL    | Reports an error that caused the current session to abort.   |\\\\n| PANIC    | Reports an error that caused all database sessions to abort. |\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- find error events\\\\n... query\\\\nwhere\\\\n  parsed.error_severity in ('ERROR', 'FATAL', 'PANIC')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFailure events include an sql\\\\\\\\_state\\\\\\\\_code that can be referenced in the [Postgres Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html)\\\\n\\\\n### By query\\\\n\\\\n> NOTE: Unless pg\\\\\\\\_audit is configured, only failed queries are logged\\\\n\\\\n    -- find queries executed by the Dashboard\\\\n    ...query\\\\n    where\\\\n      regexp_contains(parsed.query, '(?i)select . <some table>')\\\\n\\\\nQueries can use complex syntax, so it is often helpful to isolate by referenced database objects, such as `functions`, `tables`, and `columns`. Because query structures can be complex, it is advised to use [regex](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/22640) to find matches.

Those utilizing the Database REST API should reference the [Database API Logging Guide](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/22849) instead.\\\\n\\\\nWhen recording what is accessed and by whom, logging based on database roles and objects is the most reliable way to ensure a proper trail of activity.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the [pg\\\\\\\\_audit](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgaudit) extension to selectively log relevant queries (not just errors) by certain roles, against specific database objects.\\\\n\\\\nYou should take care when using the extension to not log all database events, but only what is absolutely necessary. Over-logging can strain the database and create log noise that makes it difficult to filter for relevant events.\\\\n\\\\n**Filtering by pg\\\\\\\\_audit**:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n... query\\\\nwhere\\\\n -- all pg_audit recorded events start with 'AUDIT'\\\\n regexp_contains(event_message, '^AUDIT')\\\\n  and\\\\n -- Finding queries executed from the relevant role (e.g., 'API_role')\\\\n parsed.user_name = 'API_role'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Filtering by IP\\\\n\\\\n> If you are connecting from a known, limited range of IP addresses, you should enable [network restrictions](/docs/guides/platform/network-restrictions).\\\\n\\\\nMonitoring IPs becomes tricky when dealing with dynamic addressing, such as those from serverless or edge environments. This challenge amplifies when relying on certain poolers, such as Prisma Accelerate, Supavisor, or Cloudflare's Hyperdrive, as they record the pooler's IP, not the true origin.\\\\n\\\\nIP tracking is most effective when consistently relying on direct database connections from servers with static IP addresses:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- filter by IP\\\\nselect\\\\n  event_message,\\\\n  connection_from as ip,\\\\n  count(connection_from) as ip_count\\\\nfrom\\\\n  postgres_logs\\\\n  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata\\\\n  cross join unnest(parsed) as parsed\\\\nwhere\\\\n  regexp_contains(user_name, '<ROLE>')\\\\n  and regexp_contains(backend_type, 'client backend') -- only search for connections from outside the database (excludes cron jobs)\\\\n  and regexp_contains(event_message, '^connection authenticated') -- only view successful authentication events\\\\ngroup by connection_from, event_message\\\\norder by ip_count desc\\\\nlimit 100;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n# Reviewing log settings\\\\n\\\\nThe `pg_settings` table describes system and logging configurations.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- view system variables\\\\nselect * from pg_settings;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe settings that affect logs are categorized under:\\\\n\\\\n| Category                              | Description                                                                                                   |\\\\n| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| `Reporting and Logging / What to Log` | Specifies system events worth logging.                                                                        |\\\\n| `Reporting and Logging / When to Log` | Specifies certain conditions or rules for logging                                                             |\\\\n| `Customized Options`                  | Configures extensions and loaded modules, including those enhancing logging like auto\\\\\\\\_explain and pg\\\\\\\\_audit. |\\\\n\\\\nTo view all log settings for your database, you can execute the following SQL:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- view all log related settings\\\\nselect *\\\\nfrom pg_settings\\\\nwhere\\\\n  (\\\\n    category like 'Reporting and Logging / What to Log'\\\\n    or category like 'Reporting and Logging / When to Log'\\\\n    or category = 'Customized Options'\\\\n  )\\\\n  and name like '%log%';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Changing log settings\\\\n\\\\n> WARNING: lenient settings can lead to over-logging, impacting database performance while creating noise in the logs.\\\\n\\\\n#### Severity levels\\\\n\\\\nThe `log_min_messages` variable determines what is severe enough to log.

Understanding the output of these commands can help you improve the performance of your applications by optimizing database interactions.\\\\n\\\\n### What is explain?\\\\n\\\\nThe Postgres EXPLAIN command shows the execution plan of a SQL query. This plan describes how the Postgres database will execute the query, including how tables will be scanned\\u2014by using sequential scans, index scans, etc.\\u2014and how rows will be joined.\\\\n\\\\n### How to use explain in Supabase\\\\n\\\\n**Using EXPLAIN through the SQL Editor**\\\\n\\\\n1.  Access your Supabase project\\\\n2.  Open the SQL editor\\\\n3.  Execute EXPLAIN with Your Query:\\\\n    `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1;`\\\\n\\\\n**Using EXPLAIN with supabase-js Library**\\\\n\\\\n1.  Follow the [Performance Debugging Guide](/docs/guides/database/debugging-performance) to enable the functionality on your project.\\\\n2.  Once debugging is enabled, you can use the [EXPLAIN](/docs/reference/javascript/explain?queryGroups=example\\\\\\\\&example=get-execution-plan-with-analyze-and-verbose) function in your application code. Here's how to use it\\\\n\\\\n<!---->\\\\n\\\\n    const { data, error } = await supabase\\\\n      .from('countries')\\\\n      .select()\\\\n      .explain({analyze:true,verbose:true})\\\\n\\\\n### Detailed breakdown of explain output components\\\\n\\\\n### 1. Plan type\\\\n\\\\n**- Seq Scan:** A sequential scan that reads all rows from a table. This is often seen in the absence of indexes that can be used for the query.\\\\n\\\\n**- Index Scan:** Uses an index to find rows quickly. This indicates that the query is able to use an index to efficiently locate data.\\\\n\\\\n**- Bitmap Heap Scan:** Uses a bitmap index to find rows quickly and then retrieves the actual rows from the table. This type of scan is efficient when retrieving a moderate number of rows.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Cost\\\\n\\\\n**cost=0.00..19.00:** This represents the estimated cost of executing the plan. The first number (0.00) is the cost of returning the first row, and the second number (19.00) is the total cost of executing the query and retrieving all rows. These values are arbitrary units determined by the database's cost model, not actual time or resources.\\\\n\\\\n**Start-up Cost:** The cost incurred before returning the first row.\\\\n**Total Cost:** The estimated total cost of the operation.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Rows\\\\n\\\\n**rows=1:** An estimate of the number of rows the query will return. Accurate row estimates depend on updated statistics; if the estimates are off, it might indicate that the database statistics need to be updated.\\\\n\\\\n### 4. Width\\\\n\\\\n**width=240:** The average number of bytes expected for the output rows. This indicates the expected data volume that needs to be processed or transferred, which can impact performance.\\\\n\\\\n### 5. Filters\\\\n\\\\n**Filter: (user\\\\\\\\_id = 1):** This shows any filters applied post-scan. Filters are conditions that are checked after retrieving the rows. A high number of rows being filtered out could indicate a need for better indexing.\\\\n\\\\n### 6. Execution time\\\\n\\\\n**Execution Time: 0.069 ms:** measures how long it took to actually execute the query, including retrieving the data, performing any sorts, joins, or other operations defined in the execution plan, and returning the final results. This time is measured in milliseconds.\\\\n\\\\n![image](/docs/img/troubleshooting/10950be3-264b-4a41-bc71-3d431c2756b2.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Detailed components in explain analyze\\\\n\\\\nWhen running EXPLAIN ANALYZE, additional information is provided, including:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Actual time:** Shows the time actually spent executing the scan and retrieving rows. This is split into the time to retrieve the first row (first) and the time to retrieve all rows (last).\\\\n\\\\n*   **Rows removed by filter:** Indicates how many rows were excluded due to not meeting the filter conditions.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Loops:** Shows how many times the node was executed, especially relevant in nested loop joins or subqueries.\\\\n\\\\nExample of Detailed EXPLAIN ANALYZE Output\\\\n\\\\n    Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..19.00 rows=1 width=240) (actual time=0.026..0.026 rows=1 loops=1)\\\\n      Filter: (user_id = 1)\\\\n      Rows Removed by Filter: 999\\\\n    Planning Time: 0.135 ms\\\\n\\\\n*   **actual time=0.026..0.026:** The time it took to start returning rows and to finish returning all rows.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Rows Removed by Filter:** 999: Indicates that many rows were checked against the filter, but most did not match the criteria.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Planning Time: 0.135 ms:** Planning Time refers to the amount of time the Postgres query planner takes to analyze the query and create an execution plan. This time is measured in milliseconds.\\\\n\\\\n### You might be asking yourself now, why there is two different sets of metrics : `(cost=0.42..2.64 rows=1 width=164) (actual time=0.020..0.021 rows=1 loops=1)`?\\\\n\\\\nTo answer you, one is for the estimated cost and performance, and another for the actual performance of the query as explained above.\\\\n\\\\n**Planning vs. Execution**: The estimates are based on the query planner's understanding of the data (gathered from statistics about table size, distribution of values, etc.), while the actual metrics tell you what really happened when the query ran. This comparison can highlight inaccuracies in the planner's assumptions.\\\\n\\\\n**Performance Tuning**: By comparing estimated rows and actual rows, or estimated time and actual time, you can identify potential performance issues. For example, if the estimated rows are significantly off from the actual rows, it might suggest that the table statistics are outdated, leading to inefficient query plans.\\\\n\\\\n**Identifying Bottlenecks**: If the actual time is significantly higher than expected, or if loops are more frequent than anticipated, these could be indicators of performance bottlenecks in the query.\\\\n\\\\n### How to read a complex explain output\\\\n\\\\nFirst, you have to understand that a Postgres execution plan is a tree structure consisting of several nodes. The top node (the Aggregate above) is at the top, and lower nodes are indented and start with an arrow (->). Nodes with the same indentation are on the same level (for example, the two relations combined with a join).\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example:\\\\n\\\\n    Aggregate Node (Top Node)\\\\n    \\u2502\\\\n    \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500> Sort Node\\\\n        \\u2502\\\\n        \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500> Hash Join Node\\\\n            \\u2502\\\\n            \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500> Seq Scan on users (Filtered)\\\\n            \\u2502\\\\n            \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500> Hash\\\\n                \\u2502\\\\n                \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500> Seq Scan on activities\\\\n\\\\nPostgres executes a plan top down, that is, it starts with producing the first result row for the top node. The executor processes lower nodes \\u201con demand\\u201d, that is, it fetches only as many result rows from them as it needs to calculate the next result of the upper node. This influences how you have to read \\u201ccost\\u201d and \\u201ctime\\u201d: the startup time for the upper node is at least as high as the startup time of the lower nodes, and the same holds for the total time. If you want to find the net time spent in a node, you have to subtract the time spent in the lower nodes. Parallel queries make that even more complicated.\\\\n\\\\nOn top of that, you have to multiply the cost and the time with the number of \\u201cloops\\u201d to get the total time spent in a node.\\\\n\\\\n### Common nodes in Postgres explain output\\\\n\\\\n| Node Type             | Description                                                                  |\\\\n| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| **Seq Scan**          | Scans each row of a table sequentially, often used without suitable indexes. |\\\\n| **Index Scan**        | Uses an index to quickly find rows, efficient for small fractions of rows.   |\\\\n| **Index Only Scan**   | Retrieves all needed data from the index itself, without visiting the table. |\\\\n| **Bitmap Heap Scan**  | Uses a bitmap of row locations to efficiently retrieve rows from the table.  |\\\\n| **Bitmap Index Scan** | Builds a bitmap by scanning the index to efficiently locate rows.            |\\\\n| **`Tid` Scan**        | Fetches rows directly using tuple identifiers, used in sub-selects.          |\\\\n| **Nested Loop**       | Joins two tables by scanning the first and then the second for each row.     |\\\\n| **Merge Join**        | Joins two pre-sorted tables, efficient for large datasets.                   |\\\\n| **Hash Join**         | Uses a hash table to perform joins, often faster for larger datasets.        |\\\\n| **Aggregate**         | Performs aggregation calculations like `SUM`, `COUNT`, etc.                  |\\\\n| **Sort**              | Sorts rows based on specified criteria, required for certain operations.     |\\\\n| **Limit**             | Returns a specified number of rows quickly, used with `LIMIT` clause.        |\\\\n| **CTE Scan**          | Scans a Common Table Expression, used for WITH clauses.                      |\\\\n| **Materialize**       | Materializes the result of a subquery or node to reuse without re-running.   |\\\\n| **Subquery Scan**     | Executes and provides the results of a subquery to the outer query.          |\\\\n| **Foreign Scan**      | Fetches data from foreign data sources outside the local database.           |\\\\n| **Function Scan**     | Retrieves results from a set-returning function.                             |\\\\n\\\\n### What to focus on in explain analyze output\\\\n\\\\n*   Find the nodes where most of the execution time was spent.\\\\n    `Hash Join  (cost=100.00..200.00 rows=1000 width=50) (actual time=50.012..150.023 rows=1000 loops=1)`\\\\n    Explanation:\\\\n    The actual time=50.012..150.023 indicates that this join operation took about 100 milliseconds to complete, making it a potential performance bottleneck.\\\\n*   Find the lowest node where the estimated row count is significantly different from the actual row count.\\\\n    `Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..50.00 rows=100 width=50) (actual time=0.010..25.000 rows=10000 loops=1)`\\\\n    Explanation:\\\\n    The estimated rows are 100, but the actual rows are 10,000. This discrepancy may lead the query planner to make inefficient choices, such as choosing a sequential scan over an index scan.\\\\n*   Find long-running sequential scans with a filter condition that removes many rows.\\\\n\\\\n<!---->\\\\n\\\\n    Seq Scan on products  (cost=0.00..100.00 rows=300 width=50) (actual time=50.000..100.000 rows=3 loops=1)\\\\n       Filter: (price > 1000)\\\\n       Rows Removed by Filter: 2997\\\\n\\\\nExplanation:\\\\nThis sequential scan took 50 to 100 milliseconds and filtered out 2997 of 3000 rows, indicating that only a few rows met the condition. This scenario is ideal for an index on the price column to optimize the performance by reducing the need for a full table scan.\\\\n\\\\n### Understanding the significance of milliseconds in Query Performance\\\\n\\\\nDetermining whether 100 milliseconds for e.g is noteworthy in the context of identifying performance bottlenecks depends on various factors:\\\\n\\\\n**Overall Query Execution Time:**\\\\n\\\\nIf the total execution time of a query significantly exceeds 100 milliseconds, then this particular step may not represent the main bottleneck. For instance, in queries that take several seconds to execute, a component that consumes just 100 milliseconds may not be the critical target for optimization efforts.\\\\n\\\\n**Complexity and Scale of the Query:**\\\\n\\\\nFor complex queries that involve multiple joins, subqueries, or aggregation functions, an operation that takes 100 milliseconds might actually reflect good efficiency. Conversely, for simpler queries or operations expected to be quick (such as fetching a few rows from a well-indexed table), 100 milliseconds could suggest a lack of efficiency.\\\\n\\\\nSo, the acceptable performance threshold can vary by application. For real-time systems or high-frequency trading platforms, even a few milliseconds can be critical, whereas for batch processing or data warehousing, longer execution times might be acceptable.\\\\n\\\\n### Tools to interpret explain analyze output\\\\n\\\\nSince reading a longer execution plan is quite cumbersome, you can use the website <https://explain.depesz.com/> to better visualize the query. If you paste the execution plan in the text area and hit \\u201cSubmit\\u201d, you will get output like this:\\\\n![image](/docs/img/troubleshooting/830b81aa-ae52-44a4-aa49-32c2a6296af7.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Tips for optimizing queries\\\\n\\\\n*   **Add Indexes:** Improve performance by adding indexes on columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Avoid Selecting Unused Columns:** Use SELECT to specify only the columns you need.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Update Statistics:** Ensure that statistics are up to date to help the optimizer make better choices.\\\\n\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE output can significantly enhance your ability to write efficient SQL queries. Regularly analyze query performance and make adjustments as your dataset grows and changes.\\\\n\\\\nFor more insights, you can also check out: <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/how-postgresql-processes-queries-and-how-to-analyze-them/>.\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Send SMS Hook\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Send SMS Hook\\\\n\\\\nUse your own SMS service to send authentication messages.\\\\n\\\\nThe Send SMS Hook replaces Supabase's built-in SMS sending.

This depends on your [Secure Email Change](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers?provider=Email) setting.\\\\n\\\\n*   Secure Email Change enabled: two OTPs are generated, one for the current email (`user.email`) and one for the new email (`user.email_new`). You must send two emails.\\\\n*   Secure Email Change disabled: only one OTP is generated for the new email. You send a single email.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"caution\\\\\\\" title=\\\\\\\"Counterintuitive field naming\\\\\\\">\\\\n  The token hash field names are reversed due to backward compatibility. Pay careful attention to which token/hash pair goes with which email address:\\\\n\\\\n  *   `token_hash_new` \\u2192 use with the **current** email address (`user.email`) and `token`\\\\n  *   `token_hash` \\u2192 use with the **new** email address (`user.email_new`) and `token_new`\\\\n\\\\n  Do not assume the `_new` suffix refers to the new email address.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### What to send\\\\n\\\\nWhen Secure Email Change is enabled (both token/hash pairs present):\\\\n\\\\n*   Send to **current** email address (`user.email`): use `token` with `token_hash_new`\\\\n*   Send to **new** email address (`user.email_new`): use `token_new` with `token_hash`\\\\n\\\\nWhen Secure Email Change is **disabled** (only one token/hash pair present):\\\\n\\\\n*   Send a single email to the **new** email address. Use `token` with `token_hash` or `token_new` with `token_hash`, depending on which fields are present in the payload.\\\\n\\\\n<Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"http\\\\\\\" queryGroup=\\\\\\\"language\\\\\\\">\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"sql\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"SQL\\\\\\\">\\\\n    <Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"sql-queue-email-messages\\\\\\\">\\\\n      <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"sql-queue-email-messages\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Queue Email Messages\\\\\\\">\\\\n        Your company uses a worker to manage all emails related jobs.

This metric is essential for understanding how your application tracks and synchronizes shared state between users, such as online status, user activity, or custom state information.\\\\n\\\\nThe report displays the total number of presence events sent by clients, showing state synchronization activity throughout the selected time period. Presence events occur when clients `track`, `update`, or `untrack` their presence state in a channel, triggering `sync`, `join`, or `leave` events. Unlike broadcast messages, presence state is persisted in the channel so new joiners immediately receive the current state without waiting for other users to send updates.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Presence Events chart\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/presence-events-chart-dark.png',\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/presence-events-chart-light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Actions you can take\\\\n\\\\n| Action                    | Description                                                                                                                                                         | More information                                                                       |\\\\n| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Configure presence limits | Adjust the \\\\\\\"Max presence events per second\\\\\\\" setting to optimize presence state update throughput                                                                    | [Realtime Settings Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/settings)                              |\\\\n| Review quotas             | Understand presence messages per second limits (Free: 20, Pro: 50, Pro no spend cap/Team/Enterprise: 1,000) and presence keys per object limits (10 for most plans) | [Realtime Quotas Reference](/docs/guides/realtime/quotas)                              |\\\\n| Check logs                | Investigate presence errors or quota limit issues in your project dashboard                                                                                         | [Realtime Logs Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs)                 |\\\\n| Debug with logger         | Enable logging to track presence events and diagnose state synchronization issues                                                                                   | [Debugging Realtime with Logger](/docs/troubleshooting/realtime-debugging-with-logger) |\\\\n| Learn presence basics     | Understand how to implement and optimize presence state tracking in your application                                                                                | [Presence Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/presence)                                       |\\\\n| Contact support           | Request custom quota increases for Enterprise plans or discuss presence requirements                                                                                | [Support Portal](/dashboard/support/new)                                               |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Postgres Changes Events\\\\n\\\\nThe Postgres Changes Events report helps you monitor the volume of database change events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) sent to your Realtime clients over time. This metric is essential for understanding how your application processes database changes and identifying potential performance bottlenecks or scaling issues.\\\\n\\\\nThe report displays the total number of Postgres change events received by clients, showing database change activity throughout the selected time period. Postgres Changes use logical replication to stream database changes from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to subscribed clients. Each event represents a database change that has been broadcast to clients subscribed to the relevant schema and table. Note that Postgres Changes process changes on a single thread to maintain order, which can create bottlenecks at scale compared to Broadcast.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Postgres Changes Events chart\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/postgres-changes-events-chart-dark.png',\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/postgres-changes-events-chart-light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Actions you can take\\\\n\\\\n| Action                   | Description                                                                                           | More information                                                                         |\\\\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Review quotas            | Understand Postgres change payload size limits (1,024 KB for all plans) and message throughput limits | [Realtime Quotas Reference](/docs/guides/realtime/quotas)                                |\\\\n| Check logs               | Investigate Postgres Changes errors or performance issues in your project dashboard                   | [Realtime Logs Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs)                   |\\\\n| Learn Postgres Changes   | Understand limitations and best practices for using Postgres Changes                                  | [Postgres Changes Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes)                         |\\\\n| Migrate to Broadcast     | For better scalability, consider using Broadcast with database triggers instead of Postgres Changes   | [Broadcast Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast)                                       |\\\\n| Create database triggers | Understand how to create triggers that can send Broadcast messages on database events                 | [Database Triggers Guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/triggers)                       |\\\\n| Monitor replication      | Monitor logical replication health and lag since Postgres Changes reads from the WAL                  | [Replication Monitoring Guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-monitoring) |\\\\n| Contact support          | Discuss scaling strategies or custom solutions for high-volume database change subscriptions          | [Support Portal](/dashboard/support/new)                                                 |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Rate of Channel Joins\\\\n\\\\nThe Rate of Channel Joins report helps you monitor how quickly clients are joining Realtime channels over time. This metric is essential for understanding your application's channel subscription patterns and identifying when you're approaching your plan's channel join rate limits.\\\\n\\\\nThe report displays the rate of channel joins per second, showing how frequently clients subscribe to channels throughout the selected time period. A channel join occurs whenever a client subscribes to a channel topic to receive real-time updates. Each client connection can join multiple channels (up to 100 per connection for most plans), and the join rate measures how many of these subscriptions happen per second across your entire project.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Rate of Channel Joins chart\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/rate-of-channel-joins-chart-dark.png',\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/rate-of-channel-joins-chart-light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Actions you can take\\\\n\\\\n| Action               | Description                                                                                                                                                       | More information                                                                                |\\\\n| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Review quotas        | Understand channel joins per second limits (Free: 100, Pro: 500, Pro no spend cap/Team/Enterprise: 2,500) and channels per connection limits (100 for most plans) | [Realtime Quotas Reference](/docs/guides/realtime/quotas)                                       |\\\\n| Check logs           | Investigate `too_many_joins` errors or channel join failures in your project dashboard                                                                            | [Realtime Logs Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs)                          |\\\\n| Fix channel errors   | Learn how to properly manage channel lifecycle and prevent channel leaks in your application                                                                      | [TooManyChannels Error Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/realtime-too-many-channels-error) |\\\\n| Learn channel basics | Understand how Realtime channels work and best practices for channel management                                                                                   | [Realtime Channels Concepts](/docs/guides/realtime/concepts#channels)                           |\\\\n| Contact support      | Request custom quota increases for Enterprise plans or discuss high-volume channel join requirements                                                              | [Support Portal](/dashboard/support/new)                                                        |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Message Payload Size\\\\n\\\\nThe Message Payload Size report helps you monitor the median size of message payloads sent through your Realtime channels over time.

This metric is essential for understanding the latency introduced by the database replication process when using broadcast from database.\\\\n\\\\nThe report displays the median replication lag in milliseconds, showing the delay between database commit and broadcast throughout the selected time period. When you use broadcast from database (by inserting messages into `realtime.messages`), Realtime reads changes from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) using logical replication. The lag represents the time it takes for these changes to be processed and broadcast to subscribed clients. Higher lag values indicate delays in the replication pipeline, which can impact the real-time responsiveness of your application.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Broadcast from Database Replication Lag chart\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/broadcast-from-database-replication-lag-chart-dark.png',\\\\n    light:\\\\n      '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/broadcast-from-database-replication-lag-chart-light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Actions you can take\\\\n\\\\n| Action                     | Description                                                                                                 | More information                                                                                               |\\\\n| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Check logs                 | Investigate replication errors or performance issues in your project dashboard                              | [Realtime Logs Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs)                                         |\\\\n| Monitor database           | Review database resource utilization, connection counts, and query performance that may affect replication  | [Database Observability Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/observability/database)                                |\\\\n| Review replication metrics | Use `pg_stat_subscription`, `pg_replication_slots`, and other Postgres views to diagnose replication issues | [Manual Replication Monitoring Guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/manual-replication-monitoring)         |\\\\n| Debug database issues      | Use CLI inspection tools to identify bloat, lock contention, and long-running queries affecting replication | [Database Inspection Tools Guide](/docs/guides/database/inspect)                                               |\\\\n| Optimize performance       | Optimize query performance and connection management to reduce database load                                | [Performance Tuning Guide](/docs/guides/platform/performance)                                                  |\\\\n| Configure timeouts         | Configure statement timeouts to prevent long-running transactions from blocking replication                 | [Database Timeouts Guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/timeouts)                                             |\\\\n| Learn broadcast from DB    | Understand how broadcast from database works and best practices for implementation                          | [Broadcast from Database Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast#trigger-broadcast-messages-from-your-database) |\\\\n| Contact support            | Discuss replication lag issues or request assistance with database performance optimization                 | [Support Portal](/dashboard/support/new)                                                                       |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## (Read) Private Channel Subscription RLS Execution Time\\\\n\\\\nThe (Read) Private Channel Subscription RLS Execution Time report helps you monitor the median time it takes to execute Row Level Security (RLS) policies when users subscribe to private channels.

Complex RLS policies with joins, function calls, or missing indexes can significantly increase first message publishing latency.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"(Write) Private Channel Subscription RLS Execution Time chart\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/write-private-channel-subscription-rls-execution-time-chart-dark.png',\\\\n    light:\\\\n      '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/write-private-channel-subscription-rls-execution-time-chart-light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Actions you can take\\\\n\\\\n| Action                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | More information                                                                                  |\\\\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Configure connection pool  | Adjust the \\\\\\\"Database connection pool size\\\\\\\" setting to increase the number of connections available for RLS authorization checks, which can improve performance for high-frequency message publishing | [Realtime Settings Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/settings)                                         |\\\\n| Optimize RLS policies      | Learn how to optimize RLS policies with indexes, function wrapping, and query optimization techniques                                                                                                | [RLS Performance Best Practices](/docs/troubleshooting/rls-performance-and-best-practices-Z5Jjwv) |\\\\n| Check logs                 | Investigate RLS authorization errors or timeout issues when publishing messages in your project dashboard                                                                                            | [Realtime Logs Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs)                            |\\\\n| Learn authorization basics | Understand how RLS policies work with private channels for write operations and best practices for implementation                                                                                    | [Realtime Authorization Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/authorization)                               |\\\\n| Create indexes             | Add indexes on columns used in INSERT policies to speed up write authorization checks                                                                                                                | [Database Indexes Guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes)                                  |\\\\n| Use index advisor          | Automatically detect missing indexes that could improve write RLS policy performance                                                                                                                 | [Index Advisor Extension Guide](/docs/guides/database/extensions/index_advisor)                   |\\\\n| Optimize queries           | Learn techniques for optimizing INSERT policy queries including partial indexes for specific conditions                                                                                              | [Query Optimization Guide](/docs/guides/database/query-optimization)                              |\\\\n| Monitor database           | Review database query performance and identify slow queries that may be affecting write RLS execution                                                                                                | [Database Observability Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/observability/database)                   |\\\\n| Contact support            | Discuss RLS optimization strategies or get assistance with complex authorization requirements for high-frequency messaging                                                                           | [Support Portal](/dashboard/support/new)                                                          |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Total Requests\\\\n\\\\nThe Total Requests report helps you monitor the overall volume of HTTP requests for Realtime over time.

While this design choice brings [numerous benefits](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/1098894087.31930.62.camel@localhost.localdomain), it introduces a startup penalty for new connections. Moreover, connections are more memory-intensive and can strain Postgres's internal schedulers, limiting the sustainable number that can be formed. Resultingly, developers must be mindful of how they allocate the resource.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a client (backend server) connects to Postgres, the connection is stateful and enduring, allowing clients to greedily hold onto connections without any obligation to give them up. Typically, applications do not continuously send queries to a database, so this pattern underutilizes finite connections that could have serviced other clients.\\\\n\\\\nPostgres's shortcomings are particularly evident when handling transient servers, like edge functions. They not only hoard connections for brief queries but also aggressively open and close connections, straining the database.\\\\n\\\\n### How do poolers solve the problem?\\\\n\\\\nA pooler is ultimately a load balancer for database connections. It maintains several hot connections that it triages to clients. This reduces the startup cost of creating a new process on Postgres. The pooler can also more efficiently manage a database's finite connections by only allowing clients to access them when they need to execute a query (A.K.A. transaction mode).\\\\n\\\\n### Are poolers necessary?\\\\n\\\\nAll database connection libraries, such as Prisma, SQLAlchemy, and Postgres.js have built-in poolers. These are known as application-side poolers and they are fundamental for sustainable connection management. Most libraries have default pool sizes that may need to be changed for specific workloads. As an example, most edge/serverless functions are called to service a single user's request. They usually require significantly fewer connections (often 1 is optimal) than a dedicated application server.\\\\n\\\\nNote, that like databases, servers can only maintain a certain amount of connections themselves. If you were to increase the number aggressively, the server may not be able gracefully orchestrate them. For instance, Prisma's [default pool size](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/connection-pool#connection-pool-size) is automatically set to one more than twice the server's CPU count (1 + 2 \\\\\\\\* num\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_CPUs). The Prisma Team chose this value because it is generally performant with ORM's internal architecture.\\\\n\\\\nWhen deploying to static architecture, such as long-standing containers or VMs, application-side poolers are satisfactory on their own.\\\\n\\\\nWhen connecting to your application from serverless/edge functions, horizontally auto-scaling servers, or in cases where you need more connections than what the database can manage, it's best to complement application-side poolers with a serverside one. Supabase provides Supavisor as an option, but you could use alternatives, such as Prisma's Accelerate or Cloudflare's Hyperdrive.\\\\n\\\\nThey sit between the database and your client servers. They are solely optimized for sustaining high numbers of client connections and queuing and triaging queries to the database. Although they add network complexity, they are necessary when managing auto-scaling servers that can hypothetically form an infinite amount of connections.\\\\n\\\\n### Where are the connection strings\\\\n\\\\nSupabase provides 3 database connection strings that can be used simultaneously if necessary. You can find them on the dashboard by clicking [Connect](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true).\\\\n\\\\n#### Direct connections:\\\\n\\\\n> \\\\\\\"Note uses an IPv6 address by default. [Check here to see if your network is IPv6 compatible](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27034)\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n# Example connection string\\\\npostgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.ajrbwkcuthywfihaarmflo.supabase.co:5432/postgres\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Supavisor in transaction mode (port 6543)\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n# Example transaction string\\\\npostgresql://postgres.ajrbwkcuthywddfihrmflo:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Supavisor in session mode (port 5432)\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n# Example session string\\\\npostgresql://postgres.ajrbwkcuthywfddihrmflo:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Supavisor: Transaction mode vs. Session mode?\\\\n\\\\nWhen a client forms a direct connection with Postgres, it usually will make a few queries, but may not utilize the connection the entire time. In transaction mode, a client is allowed to make a single query before being sent back to the figurative \\\\\\\"waiting room\\\\\\\". This prevents greedy or sedentary clients from hoarding connections. In most cases, this increases query throughput and is optimal.\\\\n\\\\nIn session mode, once the pooler assigns a direct connection, it stays with that client until voluntarily surrendered.\\\\n\\\\nThis behavior mirrors a direct connection, allowing greedy clients to monopolize the pool. This raises a question: what is the purpose of session mode?\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your application's configurations, having the pooler manage a queue of patient clients is preferable to the alternative of constantly polling the database to check for an available connection. Session mode can queue clients for up to a minute. If this isn't particularly relevant to your application design, then the primary benefit is that it is [IPv4 compatible](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27034). Also, unlike transaction mode, it supports prepared statements.\\\\n\\\\n### What happens when a client library, such as Prisma, connects through Supavisor?\\\\n\\\\nWhen clients connect to either Postgres or Supavisor, they do so with the Postgres Wire Protocol. Because of this, clients treat connections with pooler as if they were directly connected to Postgres. The pooler then smoothly acts as a messenger between the database and the client.\\\\n\\\\n### What are \\\\\\\"client connections\\\\\\\"?\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, they have nothing to do with front-end clients. They are the amount of backend-server connections that can connect to a serverside pooler.\\\\nImagine a chess tournament with 60 boards. Each board represents a connection in a database. When a player sits down at a board, it's like a client connecting to the database. They can take their time with their moves or just sit there, not making any.\\\\n\\\\nBut when the tournament fills up and all the boards are taken, new players are turned away, and told to check back at a later time to see if a table becomes available.\\\\n\\\\nNow, imagine the tournament organizers decide to expand the venue to house 200 people without adding more tables. Even when all boards are occupied, players don't have to leave. They can wait in the wings, and the moment a board opens up, someone from the waiting area can take their place. Likewise, if someone ends their game, but wants to play again, they can just go back to the waiting area. The waiting area represents the \\\\\\\"Max Client Connections\\\\\\\". Ultimately, the additional capacity provided by the pooler ensures fewer people are turned away from the \\\\\\\"tournament\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n### In the context of Supavisor, what does \\\\\\\"pool size\\\\\\\" mean?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Pool size\\\\\\\" refers to the maximum number of direct connections the pooler can maintain per unique user, database, and mode combination. You can adjust it in the [project connect page](/dashboard/project/_/database/settings) to strike a balance between efficient resource utilization and accommodating peak traffic.\\\\n\\\\n### What is the \\\\\\\"user+db+mode\\\\\\\" combination?\\\\n\\\\nPostgres is not actually a database. It is a Relational Database Management System (RDMS). Within it, you can spawn Postgres databases. In Supabase, it is a common pattern to just use the default database called `postgres`, but you could create more:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nCREATE DATABASE postgres;\\\\nCREATE DATABASE another_database;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a database can have many database users, but most people just rely on the default user `postgres`.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nCREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'super-secret-password;\\\\nCREATE USER some_new_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe modes are transaction (port 6543) and session (port 5432) mode.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"user+database+mode\\\\\\\" combinations are formed from the above variables and are used within the connection string:\\\\n\\\\n    postgres://[USER].shfmmplnqscentnakbkl:[password]@aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:[MODE]/[DATABASE]\\\\n\\\\nWhen a distinct combination connects to your database, a new direct connection pool will be created. That means if you have two combinations connecting and the \\\\\\\"Pool Size\\\\\\\" is set to 120, each combination will have permission to form 120 connections. This can become problematic if collectively they exhaust all available direct connections.\\\\n\\\\n### **Does Supavisor immediately establish the max pool size?**\\\\n\\\\nNo, it doesn't. Let's break it down:\\\\n\\\\n*   In transaction mode, the pooler will only add connections if there are not enough connections to service all pending queries simultaneously. If 10 clients connect, but a single direct connection can comfortably accommodate them all, the pooler will not create more.\\\\n*   If necessary, it can create as many connections to prevent queries from pending up to the limit specified by the \\\\\\\"Pool Size\\\\\\\".\\\\n*   In session mode, it will immediately create a new a direct connection for a new client unless the \\\\\\\"Pool Size\\\\\\\" is reached\\\\n*   In transaction mode, once a direct connection is established, the pooler will keep it available for reuse for another client. However, if the connection remains unused for 5 minutes, the pooler will close it to free up database resources. In session mode, the connection will be immediately closed.\\\\n*   If a client is connected to the pooler, then at least 1 hot connection will be sustained, even if no client needs it.\\\\n\\\\n### **How to change pool size**\\\\n\\\\nIn the [Dashboard's Database Settings](/dashboard/project/_/database/settings), you can configure Supavisor's \\\\\\\"Pool Size\\\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\nYou can also change the pool size for PostgREST's (DB API) internal pooler at the bottom of the [application settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).\\\\n\\\\n### Do all services on Supabase use Supavisor?\\\\n\\\\nSupabase Storage uses Supavisor internally. The other servers that communicate with Postgres (PostgREST, Realtime, and Auth) all rely on internal application poolers.\\\\n\\\\nSupavisor is primarily intended for users who do not want to rely on the Supabase Client libraries and instead prefer to work with external ORMs, such as Prisma, Drizzle, and Psycopg.\\\\n\\\\n### **Whether to change Supavisor's pool size?**\\\\n\\\\nIn an ideal scenario, Postgres would support an unlimited number of direct connections, but there's a limit to how many it can handle. If Supavisor uses most of the available connections, you risk depriving other servers, such as Auth, from accessing your database. Still, as much as possible, you want to give your pooler freedom to grow its pool as needed to service demand.\\\\n\\\\nIt's important to note that the Storage server also uses Supavisor as a unique \\\\\\\"user+db+mode\\\\\\\" combination, so the pool size you set for your general application will apply to it, too.\\\\n\\\\nAs a rule of thumb, if you're using the DB REST API or multiple app-based \\\\\\\"user+db+mode\\\\\\\" combinations, try to keep the pooler's usage under 40% of available connections. Otherwise, you can cautiously increase usage to around 80%. These percentages are flexible and depend on your application's usage and setup. Monitor connection usage to determine the optimal allocation without depriving other servers of necessary connections.\\\\n\\\\n### **How to monitor connections**\\\\n\\\\n> EDIT: a more in-depth [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27141) for connection monitoring was published\\\\n\\\\nConnection usage can be monitored with a Supabase Grafana Dashboard. It provides realtime visibility of over 200 database metrics, such as graphs of CPU, EBS, and active direct/pooler connections. It can be extremely useful for monitoring and debugging instances.\\\\n\\\\nYou can check our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-grafana) for setup instructions for local deployments or free cloud deployments on [Fly.io](http://fly.io/). Refer to Supabase [documentation](/docs/guides/platform/metrics) to learn more about the metrics endpoint.\\\\n\\\\n### **Can Supavisor really support a million connections?**\\\\n\\\\nIt depends.\\\\n\\\\nIn the article [\\\\\\\"Supavisor: Scaling Postgres to 1 Million Connections\\\\\\\"](/blog/supavisor-1-million) we gave Supavisor the capacity to connect to a million clients simultaneously. The pooler triaged the clients' queries to 400 database connections.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is important is that the database processing these queries had 64vCPUs and 256GB of memory. It could process the queries fast enough to ensure that there was never a noticeable bottleneck. The clients never waited long enough to timeout. If the clients were asking to run inefficient queries, like the one below, a severe backlog of pending client queries would have formed:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- do nothing for 60 seconds\\\\nselect pg_sleep(60);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nA backlog could also happen if there are not enough direct connections available. In our setup, 400 connections were enough to handle a million clients, ensuring a smooth flow of requests. But if we had only 1 direct connection, the queue would've moved too slowly and clients would expire their requests.\\\\n\\\\nScaling to this level only works when the pooler is operating in transaction mode. In Session mode, hypothetically, the 400 clients that first accessed the direct connections could keep them, even if they are no longer executing queries. The pending 999,600 clients waiting for a turn would then be starved of direct connections.\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Database Replication\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Database Replication\\\\n\\\\nAn introduction to database replication and change data capture.\\\\n\\\\nReplication is the process of copying changes from your database to another location. It's also referred to as change data capture (CDC): capturing all the changes that occur to your data.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Use cases\\\\n\\\\nYou might use database replication for:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Analytics and Data Warehousing**: Replicate your operational database to analytics platforms for complex analysis without impacting your application's performance.\\\\n*   **Data Integration**: Keep your data synchronized across different systems and services in your tech stack.\\\\n*   **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Maintain up-to-date copies of your data in different locations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Replication methods\\\\n\\\\nSupabase supports two methods for replicating your database to external destinations:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Replication\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"caution\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Private Alpha\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Replication is currently in private alpha. Access is limited and features may change.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\nReplication powered by [Supabase ETL](https://github.com/supabase/etl) automatically replicates data to supported systems.\\\\n\\\\n*   [Set up replication](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-setup)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Manual replication\\\\n\\\\nConfigure your own replication using external tools and Postgres's native logical replication. This gives you full control over the replication process and allows you to use any tool that supports Postgres logical replication.\\\\n\\\\n*   [Set up Manual Replication](/docs/guides/database/replication/manual-replication-setup)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Related features\\\\n\\\\nChoose the data syncing method based on your use case:\\\\n\\\\n*   For realtime features and syncing data to clients (browsers, mobile apps), see [Realtime](/docs/guides/realtime)\\\\n*   For deploying read-only databases across multiple regions, see [Read Replicas](/docs/guides/platform/read-replicas)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Concepts and terms\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Write-Ahead Log (WAL)\\\\n\\\\nPostgres uses a system called the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to manage changes to the database. As you make changes, they are appended to the WAL, which is a series of files (also called \\\\\\\"segments\\\\\\\") where the file size can be specified. Once one segment is full, Postgres will start appending to a new segment. After a period of time, a checkpoint occurs and Postgres synchronizes the WAL with your database. Once the checkpoint is complete, then the WAL files can be removed from disk and free up space.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Logical replication and WAL\\\\n\\\\nLogical replication is a method of replication where Postgres uses the WAL files and transmit those changes to another Postgres database, or a system that supports reading WAL files.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### LSN\\\\n\\\\nLSN is a Log Sequence Number that is used to identify the position of a WAL file in the WAL directory. It is often used to determine the progress of replication in subscribers and calculate the lag of a replication slot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Logical replication architecture\\\\n\\\\nWhen setting up logical replication, three key components are involved:\\\\n\\\\n*   `publication` - A set of tables on your primary database that will be `published`\\\\n*   `replication slot` - A slot used for replicating the data from a single publication. The slot, when created, will specify the output format of the changes\\\\n*   `subscription` - A subscription is created from an external system (i.e. another Postgres database) and must specify the name of the `publication`. If you do not specify a replication slot, one is automatically created\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Logical replication output format\\\\n\\\\nLogical replication is typically output in 2 forms, `pgoutput` and `wal2json`. The output method is how Postgres sends changes to any active replication slot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Logical replication configuration\\\\n\\\\nWhen using logical replication, Postgres is then configured to keep WAL files around for longer than it needs them. If the files are removed too quickly, then your `replication slot` will become inactive and, if the database receives a large number of changes in a short time, then the `replication slot` can become lost as it was not able to keep up.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to mitigate this, Postgres has many options and settings that can be [tweaked](/docs/guides/database/custom-postgres-config) to manage the WAL usage effectively. Not all of these settings are user configurable as they can impact the stability of your database. For those that are, these should be considered as advanced configuration and not changed without understanding that they can cause additional disk space and resources to be used, as well as incur additional costs.\\\\n\\\\n| Setting                                                                                  | Description                                            | User-facing | Default |\\\\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------- |\\\\n| [`max_replication_slots`](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/max_replication_slots/)   | Max count of replication slots allowed                 | No          |         |\\\\n| [`wal_keep_size`](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/wal_keep_size/)                   | Minimum size of WAL files to keep for replication      | No          |         |\\\\n| [`max_slot_wal_keep_size`](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/max_slot_wal_keep_size/) | Max WAL size that can be reserved by replication slots | No          |         |\\\\n| [`checkpoint_timeout`](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/checkpoint_timeout/)         | Max time between WAL checkpoints                       | No          |         |\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Understanding API keys\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Understanding API keys\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSupabase gives you fine-grained control over which application components are allowed to access your project through API keys.\\\\n\\\\nAPI keys provide the first layer of authentication for data access.

Use the publishable and secret keys instead.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\" title=\\\\\\\"Changes to API keys\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Supabase is changing the way keys work to improve project security and developer experience. You can [read the full announcement](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260), but in the transition period, you can use both the current `anon` and `service_role` keys and the new publishable key with the form `sb_publishable_xxx` which will replace the older keys.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Where to find keys\\\\n\\\\nYou can find API keys in a couple of different places.\\\\n\\\\nIn most cases, you can get the correct key from [the Project's **Connect** dialog](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true), but if you want a specific key, you can find all keys in [the API Keys section of a Project's Settings page](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys/):\\\\n\\\\n*   **For legacy keys**, copy the `anon` key for client-side operations and the `service_role` key for server-side operations from the **Legacy API Keys** tab.\\\\n*   **For new keys**, open the **API Keys** tab, if you don't have a publishable key already, click **Create new API Keys**, and copy the value from the **Publishable key** section.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## `anon` and publishable keys\\\\n\\\\nThe `anon` and publishable keys secure the public components of your application. Public components run in environments where it is impossible to secure any secrets. These include:\\\\n\\\\n*   Web pages, where the key is bundled in source code.\\\\n*   Mobile or desktop applications, where the key is bundled inside the compiled packages or executables.\\\\n*   CLI, scripts, tools, or other pre-built executables.\\\\n*   Other publicly available APIs that return the key without prior additional authorization.\\\\n\\\\nThese environments are always considered public because anyone can retrieve the key from the source code or build artifacts. Obfuscation can increase the difficulty, but never eliminate the possibility. (In general, obfuscation, Turing test challenges, and specialized knowledge do not count as authorization for the purpose of securing secrets.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Interaction with Supabase Auth\\\\n\\\\nUsing the `anon` or publishable key does not mean that your user is anonymous. (Thinking of both these keys as publishable rather than `anon` makes the mental model clearer.)\\\\n\\\\nYour application can be authenticated with the publishable key, while your user is authenticated (via Supabase Auth) with their personal JWT:\\\\n\\\\n| Key             | User logged in via Supabase Auth | Postgres role used for RLS, etc. |\\\\n| --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\\\\n| Publishable key | No                               | `anon`                           |\\\\n| `anon`          | No                               | `anon`                           |\\\\n| Publishable key | Yes                              | `authenticated`                  |\\\\n| `anon`          | Yes                              | `authenticated`                  |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Protection\\\\n\\\\nThese keys provide first-layer protection to your project's data, performance and bill, such as:\\\\n\\\\n*   Providing basic Denial-of-Service protection, by requiring a minimal threshold of knowledge.\\\\n*   Protecting your bill by ignoring bots, scrapers, automated vulnerability scanners and other well meaning or random Internet activity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Security considerations\\\\n\\\\nThe publishable and `anon` keys are not intended to protect from the following, since key retrieval is always possible from a public component:\\\\n\\\\n*   Static or dynamic code analysis and reverse engineering attempts.\\\\n*   Use of the Network inspector in the browser.\\\\n*   Cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting, phishing attacks.\\\\n*   Man-in-the-middle attacks.\\\\n\\\\nWhen using the publishable or `anon` key, access to your project's data is guarded by Postgres via the built-in `anon` and `authenticated` roles. For full protection make sure:\\\\n\\\\n*   You have enabled Row Level Security on all tables.\\\\n*   You regularly review your Row Level Security policies for permissions granted to the `anon` and `authenticated` roles.\\\\n*   You do not modify the role's attributes without understanding the changes you are making.\\\\n\\\\nYour project's [Security Advisor](/dashboard/project/_/advisors/security) constantly checks for common security problems with the built-in Postgres roles. Make sure you carefully review each finding before dismissing it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## `service_role` and secret keys\\\\n\\\\nUnlike the `anon` and publishable key, the `service_role` and secret keys allow elevated access to your project's data. It is meant to be used only in secure, developer-controlled components of your application, such as:\\\\n\\\\n*   Servers that implement prior authorization themselves, such as Edge Functions, microservices, traditional or specialized web servers.\\\\n*   Periodic jobs, queue processors, topic subscribers.\\\\n*   Admin and back-office tools, with prior authorization checks only.\\\\n*   Data processing pipelines, such as for analytics, reports, backups, or database synchronization.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"caution\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Never expose your `service_role` and secret keys publicly. Your data is at risk. **Do not:**\\\\n\\\\n  *   Add in web pages, public documents, source code, bundle in executables or packages for mobile, desktop or CLI apps.\\\\n  *   Send over chat applications, email or SMS to your peers.\\\\n  *   Never use in a browser, even on `localhost`!\\\\n  *   Do not pass in URLs or query params, as these are often logged.\\\\n  *   Be careful passing them in request headers without prior log sanitization.\\\\n  *   Take extra care logging even potentially **invalid API keys**. Simple typos might reveal the real key in the future.\\\\n  *   Reveal, copy, use or manipulate on hardware devices without full disk encryption and which you do not directly own or control (such as public computers, friend's laptop, etc.)\\\\n\\\\n  Ensure you handle them with care and using [secure coding practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/stable-en/).\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\nSecret keys and the `service_role` JWT-based API key authorize access to your project's data via the built-in `service_role` Postgres role. By design, this role has full access to your project's data. It also uses the [`BYPASSRLS` attribute](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html#:~:text=BYPASSRLS), skipping any and all Row Level Security policies you attach.\\\\n\\\\nThe secret key is an improvement over the old JWT-based `service_role` key, and we recommend using it where possible. It adds more checks to prevent misuse, specifically:\\\\n\\\\n*   You cannot use a secret key in the browser (matches on the `User-Agent` header) and it will always reply with HTTP 401 Unauthorized.\\\\n*   You don't need to have any secret keys if you are not using them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Best practices for handling secret keys\\\\n\\\\nBelow are some starting guidelines on how to securely work with secret keys:\\\\n\\\\n*   Always work with secret keys on computers you fully own or control.\\\\n*   Use secure & encrypted send tools to share API keys with others (often provided by good password managers), but prefer the [API Keys](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys) dashboard instead.\\\\n*   Prefer encrypting them when stored in files or environment variables.\\\\n*   Do not add in source control, especially for CI scripts and tools. Prefer using the tool's native secrets capability instead.\\\\n*   Prefer using a separate secret key for each separate backend component of your application, so that if one is found to be vulnerable or to have leaked the key you will only need to change it and not all.\\\\n*   Even though a secret key will always return HTTP 401 Unauthorized error when used in a browser, it does not mean that attackers will not use it with other tools. Delete immediately!\\\\n*   If you must include them in logs, log the first few random characters (but never more than 6).\\\\n*   If you wish to log or store which valid API key was used, store it as a SHA256 hash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### What to do if a secret key or `service_role` has been leaked or compromised?\\\\n\\\\nDon't rush if this has happened, or you are suspecting it has. Make sure you have fully considered the situation and have remediated the root cause of the suspicion or vulnerability **first**. Consider using the [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) as an easy way to identify the severity of the incident and to plan your next steps.\\\\n\\\\nRotating a secret key (`sb_secret_...`) is easy and painless. Use the [API Keys](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys) dashboard to create a new secret API key, then replace it with the compromised key. Once all components are using the new key, delete the compromised one.\\\\n\\\\n**Deleting a secret key is irreversible and once done it will be gone forever.**\\\\n\\\\nIf you are still using the JWT-based `service_role` key, there are two options.\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Strongly recommended:** Replace the `service_role` key with a new secret key instead. Follow the guide from above as if you are rotating an existing secret key.\\\\n2.  [Rotate your project's JWT secret.](/dashboard/project/_/settings/jwt) This operation is only recommended if you suspect that the JWT secret has leaked itself. Consider switching your `anon` JWT-based key to the publishable key, and all `service_role` JWT-based keys to secret keys. Only then rotate the JWT secret. Check the FAQ below if you use the JWT-based keys in mobile, desktop or CLI applications!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Known limitations and compatibility differences\\\\n\\\\nAs the publishable and secret keys are no longer JWT-based, there are some known limitations and compatibility differences that you may need to plan for:\\\\n\\\\n*   You cannot send a publishable or secret key in the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header, except if the value exactly equals the `apikey` header. In this case, your request will be forwarded down to your project's database, but will be rejected as the value is not a JWT.\\\\n*   Edge Functions **only support JWT verification** via the `anon` and `service_role` JWT-based API keys. You will need to use the `--no-verify-jwt` option when using publishable and secret keys. The Supabase platform does not verify the `apikey` header when using Edge Functions in this way. Implement your own `apikey`-header authorization logic inside the Edge Function code itself.\\\\n*   Public Realtime connections are limited to 24 hours in duration, unless the connection is upgraded and further maintained with user-level authentication via Supabase Auth or a supported Third-Party Auth provider.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Frequently asked questions\\\\n\\\\n{/* supa-mdx-lint-disable Rule004ExcludeWords */}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### I am using JWT-based `anon` key in a mobile, desktop, or CLI application and need to rotate my `service_role` JWT secret?\\\\n\\\\nIf you know or suspect that the JWT secret itself is leaked, refer to the section on [rotating the JWT](#what-to-do-if-a-secret-key-or-servicerole-has-been-leaked-or-compromised).\\\\n\\\\nIf the JWT secret is secure, prefer substituting the `service_role` JWT-based key with a new secret key which you can create in the [API Keys](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys) dashboard. This will prevent downtime for your application.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Can I still use my old `anon` and `service-role` API keys after enabling the publishable and secret keys?\\\\n\\\\nYes. This allows you to transition between the API keys with zero downtime by gradually swapping your clients while both sets of keys are active. See the next question for how to deactivate your keys once all your clients are switched over.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### How do I deactivate the `anon` and `service_role` JWT-based API keys after moving to publishable and secret keys?\\\\n\\\\nYou can do this in the [API Keys](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys) dashboard. To prevent downtime in your application's components, use the last used indicators on the page to confirm that these are no longer used before deactivating.\\\\n\\\\nYou can re-activate them should you need to.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Why are `anon` and `service_role` JWT-based keys no longer recommended?\\\\n\\\\nSince the start of Supabase, the JWT-based `anon` and `service_role` keys were the right trade-off against simplicity and relative security for your project. Unfortunately they pose some real challenges in live applications, especially around rotation and security best practices.\\\\n\\\\nThe main reasons for preferring the publishable and secret keys (`sb_publishable_...` and `sb_secret_...`) are:\\\\n\\\\n*   Tight coupling between the JWT secret (which itself can be compromised, if you mint your own JWTs), the `anon` (low privilege) and `service_role` (high privilege) and `authenticated` (issued by Supabase Auth) Postgres roles.\\\\n*   Inability to independently rotate each aspect of the keys, without downtime.\\\\n*   Inability to roll-back an unnecessary or problematic JWT secret rotation.\\\\n*   Publishing new versions of mobile applications can take days and often weeks in the app review phase with Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. A forced rotation can cause weeks of downtime for mobile app users.\\\\n*   Users may continue using desktop, CLI and mobile apps with very old versions, making rotation impossible without a forced version upgrade.\\\\n*   JWTs had 10-year expiry duration, giving malicious actors more to work with.\\\\n*   JWTs were self-referential and full of redundant information not necessary for achieving their primary purpose.\\\\n*   JWTs are large, hard to parse, verify, and manipulate -- leading to insecure logging or bad security practices.\\\\n*   They were signed with a symmetric JWT secret.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Why is there no publishable or secret keys in the CLI / self-hosting?\\\\n\\\\nPublishable and secret keys are only available on the Supabase hosted platform. They are managed by our API Gateway component, which does not currently have a CLI equivalent.\\\\n\\\\nWe are looking into providing similar but limited in scope support for publishable or secret keys in the future. For now you can only use the `anon` and `service_role` JWT-based keys there.\\\\n\\\\nFor advanced users, see the following question on how these keys are implemented on the hosted platform for an idea on how to provide similar functionality for yourself.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### How are publishable and secret keys implemented on the hosted platform?\\\\n\\\\nWhen your applications use the Supabase APIs they go through a component called the API Gateway on the Supabase hosted platform. This provides us (and therefore you) with the following features:\\\\n\\\\n*   Observability and logging.\\\\n*   Performance and request routing (such as to read-replicas).\\\\n*   Security, for blocking malicious patterns or behavior on a global scale.\\\\n\\\\nThis API Gateway component is able to verify the API key (sent in the `apikey` request header, or for WebSocket in a query param) against your project's publishable and secret key list. If the match is found, it mints a temporary, short-lived JWT that is then forwarded down to your project's servers.\\\\n\\\\nIt may be possible to replicate similar behavior if you self-host by using programmable proxies such as [Kong](https://konghq.com/), [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) or similar.\\\\n\\\"}]}}\", \"annotations\": null, \"meta\": null}], \"structuredContent\": null, \"isError\": false}",

Postgres is the core of Supabase\\u2014for example, you can use row-level security, and there are more than 40 Postgres extensions available.\\\\n\\\\nThis guide demonstrates how to migrate your Postgres database to Supabase to get the most out of Postgres while gaining access to all the features you need to build a project.\\\\n\\\\nThis guide provides three methods for migrating your Postgres database to Supabase:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Google Colab** - Guided notebook with copy-paste workflow\\\\n2.  **Manual Dump/Restore** - CLI approach, works for all versions\\\\n3.  **Logical Replication** - Minimal downtime, requires Postgres 10+\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Connection modes\\\\n\\\\nSupabase provides the following connection modes:\\\\n\\\\n*   Direct connection\\\\n*   Supavisor session mode\\\\n*   Supavisor transaction mode\\\\n\\\\nUse Supavisor session mode for the database migration tasks (pg\\\\\\\\_dump/restore and logical replication).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Method 1: Google Colab (easiest)\\\\n\\\\nSupabase provides a Google Colab migration notebook for a guided migration experience:\\\\n[Supabase Migration Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mansueli/Supa-Migrate/blob/main/Migrate_Postgres_Supabase.ipynb)\\\\n\\\\nThis is ideal if you prefer a step-by-step, copy-paste workflow with minimal setup.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Method 2: Manual dump/restore\\\\n\\\\nThis method works for all Postgres versions using CLI tools.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Prerequisites\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Source Postgres requirements\\\\n\\\\n*   Connection string with rights to run `pg_dump`\\\\n*   No special settings required for dump/restore\\\\n*   Network access from migration VM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Migration environment\\\\n\\\\n*   Cloud VM running Ubuntu in the same region as source or target database\\\\n*   Postgres client tools matching your source database version\\\\n*   tmux for session persistence\\\\n*   Sufficient disk space (usually ~50% of source database size is enough, but varies case by case)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Pre-Migration checklist\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Check database size\\\\nselect pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) as size;\\\\n\\\\n-- Check Postgres version\\\\nselect version();\\\\n\\\\n-- List installed extensions\\\\nselect * from pg_extension order by extname;\\\\n\\\\n-- Check active connections\\\\nselect count(*) from pg_stat_activity;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Check available extensions in Supabase\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Connect to your Supabase database and check available extensions\\\\nSELECT name, comment FROM pg_available_extensions ORDER BY name;\\\\n\\\\n-- Compare with source database extensions\\\\nSELECT extname FROM pg_extension ORDER BY extname;\\\\n\\\\n-- Install needed extensions\\\\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS extension_name;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Step 1: Set up migration VM\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"tip\\\\\\\">\\\\n  For optimal performance, run the migration from a cloud VM, not your local machine.

Storage objects transfer or redeploying edge functions is not covered here.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Before you begin\\\\n\\\\nYou need:\\\\n\\\\n*   A new self-hosted Supabase instance ([Docker setup guide](/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker))\\\\n*   [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) installed (or use `npx supabase`)\\\\n*   [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) installed (required by the CLI)\\\\n*   `psql` installed ([official installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/))\\\\n*   Your Supabase database passwords (for platform and self-hosted)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 1: Get your platform connection string\\\\n\\\\nOn your managed Supabase project dashboard, click [**Connect**](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) and copy the connection string (use the session pooler or direct connection).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 2: Back up your platform database\\\\n\\\\nExport roles, schema, and data as three separate SQL files:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nsupabase db dump --db-url \\\\\\\"[CONNECTION_STRING]\\\\\\\" -f roles.sql --role-only\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nsupabase db dump --db-url \\\\\\\"[CONNECTION_STRING]\\\\\\\" -f schema.sql\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nsupabase db dump --db-url \\\\\\\"[CONNECTION_STRING]\\\\\\\" -f data.sql --use-copy --data-only\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis produces SQL files that are compatible across Postgres versions.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Using `supabase db dump` executes `pg_dump` under the hood but applies Supabase-specific filtering - it excludes internal schemas, strips reserved roles, and adds idempotent `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses. Using raw `pg_dump` directly will include Supabase internals and cause permission errors during restore. CLI requires Docker because it runs `pg_dump` inside a container from the Supabase Postgres image rather than requiring a local Postgres installation.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 3: Prepare your self-hosted instance\\\\n\\\\nBefore restoring, check the following on your self-hosted instance:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Extensions**: Enable any non-default extensions your Supabase project uses. You can check which extensions are active by querying `select * from pg_extension;` on your managed database (or check Database Extensions in Dashboard).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 4: Restore to your self-hosted database\\\\n\\\\nConnect to your self-hosted Postgres and restore the dump files. The [default](/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#accessing-postgres) connection string for self-hosted Supabase is:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\npostgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhere `[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]` is the value of `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in your self-hosted `.env` file.\\\\n\\\\nUse your domain name, your server IP, or localhost for `[your-domain]` depending on whether you are running self-hosted Supabase on a VPS, or locally.\\\\n\\\\nRun `psql` to restore:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npsql \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --single-transaction \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --variable ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --file roles.sql \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --file schema.sql \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --command 'SET session_replication_role = replica' \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --file data.sql \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --dbname \\\\\\\"postgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nSetting `session_replication_role` to `replica` disables triggers during the data import, preventing issues like double-encryption of columns.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Step 5: Verify the restore\\\\n\\\\nConnect to your self-hosted database and run a few checks:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npsql \\\\\\\"postgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Check your tables are present\\\\n\\\\\\\\dt public.*\\\\n\\\\n-- Verify row counts on key tables\\\\nSELECT count(*) FROM auth.users;\\\\n\\\\n-- Check extensions\\\\nSELECT * FROM pg_extension;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## What's included and what's not\\\\n\\\\nThe database dump includes your schema, data, roles, RLS policies, database functions, triggers, and `auth.users`. However, several things require separate configuration on your self-hosted instance:\\\\n\\\\n| Requires manual setup                       | How to configure                                  |\\\\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| JWT secrets and API keys                    | Generate new ones and update `.env`               |\\\\n| Auth provider settings (OAuth, Apple, etc.) | Configure `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_*` variables in `.env` |\\\\n| Edge functions                              | Manually copy to your self-hosted instance        |\\\\n| Storage objects                             | Transfer separately (not covered in this guide)   |\\\\n| SMTP / email settings                       | Configure `SMTP_*` variables in `.env`            |\\\\n| Custom domains and DNS                      | Point your DNS to the self-hosted server          |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Auth considerations\\\\n\\\\nYour `auth.users` table and related data are included in the database dump, so user accounts are preserved. However:\\\\n\\\\n*   **JWT secrets differ** between your platform and self-hosted instances. Existing tokens issued by the platform project will not be valid. Users will need to re-authenticate.\\\\n*   **Social auth providers** (Apple, Google, GitHub, etc.) need to be configured in your self-hosted `.env` file. Set the relevant `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_*` variables. See the Auth repository [README](https://github.com/supabase/auth) for all available options.\\\\n*   **Redirect URLs** in your OAuth provider consoles (Apple Developer, Google Cloud Console, etc.) must be updated to point to your self-hosted hostname instead of `*.supabase.co`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Postgres version compatibility\\\\n\\\\nManaged Supabase may run a newer Postgres version (Postgres 17) than the self-hosted Docker image (currently Postgres 15). The `supabase db dump` command produces plain SQL files that work across major Postgres versions.\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind:\\\\n\\\\n*   The data dump may include Postgres 17-only settings or reference tables/columns from newer Auth and Storage versions that don't exist on self-hosted yet. See [Version mismatches](#version-mismatches-between-platform-and-self-hosted) in the troubleshooting section.\\\\n*   Run the restore on a test self-hosted instance first to identify any incompatibilities.\\\\n*   Check that all extensions you use are available on the self-hosted Postgres version.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Troubleshooting\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Version mismatches between platform and self-hosted\\\\n\\\\nThe platform may run a newer Postgres version (17 vs 15) and newer Auth service versions than self-hosted. The data dump can contain settings, tables, or columns that don't exist on your new self-hosted instance.\\\\n\\\\n**Common issues in `data.sql`:**\\\\n\\\\n*   `SET transaction_timeout = 0` - a Postgres 17-only setting that fails on Postgres 15\\\\n*   `COPY` statements for tables that don't exist on self-hosted (e.g., `auth.oauth_clients`, `storage.buckets_vectors`, `storage.vector_indexes`)\\\\n*   `COPY` statements with columns added in newer Auth versions (e.g., `auth.flow_state` with `oauth_client_state_id`, `linking_target_id`)\\\\n\\\\n**Workaround:** Edit `data.sql` before restoring:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\n# Comment out PG17-only transaction_timeout\\\\nsed -i 's/^SET transaction_timeout/-- &/' data.sql\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor missing tables or column mismatches, comment out the relevant `COPY ... FROM stdin;` line and its corresponding `\\\\\\\\.` terminator. Run the restore without `--single-transaction` first to identify all failures, then fix them and run the final restore with `--single-transaction`.\\\\n\\\\nKeeping your self-hosted configuration [up to date](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker/CHANGELOG.md) will minimize these gaps.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Extension not available\\\\n\\\\nIf the restore fails because an extension isn't available, check whether it's supported on your self-hosted Postgres version. You can list available extensions with:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Connection refused\\\\n\\\\nMake sure your self-hosted Postgres port is accessible. In the default [self-hosted Supabase](/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#accessing-postgres) setup, the user is `postgres.your-tenant-id` with Supavisor on port `5432`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Legacy Studio configuration\\\\n\\\\nStudio in self-hosted Supabase historically used `supabase_admin` role (superuser) instead of `postgres`. Objects created via Studio UI were owned by `supabase_admin`. Check your `docker-compose.yml` [configuration](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/2cb5befaa377a42b6d6ca152b98105b59054f2f4/docker/docker-compose.yml#L30) to see if `POSTGRES_USER_READ_WRITE` is set to `postgres`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Custom roles missing passwords\\\\n\\\\nIf you created custom database roles with the `LOGIN` attribute on your platform project, their passwords are not included in the dump. Set them manually after restore:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nALTER ROLE your_custom_role WITH PASSWORD 'new-password';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Additional resources\\\\n\\\\n*   [Backup and Restore using the CLI](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/backup-restore)\\\\n*   [Restore Dashboard backup](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/dashboard-restore)\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Tables and Data\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Tables and Data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTables are where you store your data.\\\\n\\\\nTables are similar to excel spreadsheets.

`timestamp` to a `date`, you will lose all the time information that was previously saved.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Primary keys\\\\n\\\\nA table can have a \\\\\\\"primary key\\\\\\\" - a unique identifier for every row of data. A few tips for Primary Keys:\\\\n\\\\n*   It's recommended to create a Primary Key for every table in your database.\\\\n*   You can use any column as a primary key, as long as it is unique for every row.\\\\n*   It's common to use a `uuid` type or a numbered `identity` column as your primary key.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table movies (\\\\n  id bigint generated always as identity primary key\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn the example above, we have:\\\\n\\\\n1.  created a column called `id`\\\\n2.  assigned the data type `bigint`\\\\n3.  instructed the database that this should be `generated always as identity`, which means that Postgres will automatically assign a unique number to this column.\\\\n4.  Because it's unique, we can also use it as our `primary key`.\\\\n\\\\nWe could also use `generated by default as identity`, which would allow us to insert our own unique values.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table movies (\\\\n  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Loading data\\\\n\\\\nThere are several ways to load data in Supabase. You can load data directly into the database or using the [APIs](../../guides/database/api).\\\\nUse the \\\\\\\"Bulk Loading\\\\\\\" instructions if you are loading large data sets.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Basic data loading\\\\n\\\\n<Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"sql\\\\\\\" queryGroup=\\\\\\\"language\\\\\\\">\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"sql\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"SQL\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```sql\\\\n    insert into movies\\\\n      (name, description)\\\\n    values\\\\n      (\\\\n        'The Empire Strikes Back',\\\\n        'After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.'\\\\n      ),\\\\n      (\\\\n        'Return of the Jedi',\\\\n        'After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.'\\\\n      );\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"js\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"JavaScript\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```js\\\\n    const { data, error } = await supabase.from('movies').insert([\\\\n      {\\\\n        name: 'The Empire Strikes Back',\\\\n        description:\\\\n          'After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.',\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        name: 'Return of the Jedi',\\\\n        description:\\\\n          'After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.',\\\\n      },\\\\n    ])\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"dart\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Dart\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```dart\\\\n    await supabase\\\\n      .from('movies')\\\\n      .insert([{\\\\n        name: 'The Empire Strikes Back',\\\\n        description: 'After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.'\\\\n      }, {\\\\n        name: 'Return of the Jedi',\\\\n        description: 'After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.'\\\\n      }]);\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"swift\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Swift\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```swift\\\\n    try await supabase.from(\\\\\\\"movies\\\\\\\")\\\\n      .insert(\\\\n        [\\\\n          [\\\\n            \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\\\\\",\\\\n            \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\n              \\\\\\\"After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.\\\\\\\",\\\\n          ],\\\\n          [\\\\n            \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Return of the Jedi\\\\\\\",\\\\n            \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\n              \\\\\\\"After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.\\\\\\\",\\\\n          ],\\\\n        ]\\\\n      )\\\\n      .execute()\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Python\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```python\\\\n    client.from_(\\\\\\\"movies\\\\\\\").insert([\\\\n        {\\\\n            \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\\\\\",\\\\n            \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.\\\\\\\"\\\\n        },\\\\n        {\\\\n            \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Return of the Jedi\\\\\\\",\\\\n            \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.\\\\\\\"\\\\n        }\\\\n    ]).execute()\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"kotlin\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Kotlin\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```kotlin\\\\n    @Serializable\\\\n    data class Movie(\\\\n        val name: String,\\\\n        val description: String\\\\n    )\\\\n    ```\\\\n\\\\n    ```kotlin\\\\n    supabase\\\\n        .from(\\\\\\\"movies\\\\\\\")\\\\n        .insert(listOf(\\\\n            Movie(\\\\\\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.\\\\\\\"),\\\\n            Movie(\\\\\\\"Return of the Jedi\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.\\\\\\\"),\\\\n        ))\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n</Tabs>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Bulk data loading\\\\n\\\\nWhen inserting large data sets it's best to use PostgreSQL's [COPY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) command.\\\\nThis loads data directly from a file into a table. There are several file formats available for copying data: text, CSV, binary, JSON, etc.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if you wanted to load a CSV file into your movies table:\\\\n\\\\n```text ./movies.csv\\\\n\\\\\\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\\\"Return of the Jedi\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou would [connect](../../guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections) to your database directly and load the file with the COPY command:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npsql -h DATABASE_URL -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres \\\\\\\\\\\\n  -c \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\COPY movies FROM './movies.csv';\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally use the `DELIMITER`, `HEADER` and `FORMAT` options as defined in the Postgres [COPY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) docs.\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npsql -h DATABASE_URL -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres \\\\\\\\\\\\n  -c \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\COPY movies FROM './movies.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you receive an error `FATAL:  password authentication failed for user \\\\\\\"postgres\\\\\\\"`, reset your database password in the Database Settings and try again.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Joining tables with foreign keys\\\\n\\\\nTables can be \\\\\\\"joined\\\\\\\" together using Foreign Keys.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Foreign Keys\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/database/managing-tables/joining-tables.png',\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/database/managing-tables/joining-tables--light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\nThis is where the \\\\\\\"Relational\\\\\\\" naming comes from, as data typically forms some sort of relationship.\\\\n\\\\nIn our \\\\\\\"movies\\\\\\\" example above, we might want to add a \\\\\\\"category\\\\\\\" for each movie (for example, \\\\\\\"Action\\\\\\\", or \\\\\\\"Documentary\\\\\\\").\\\\nLet's create a new table called `categories` and \\\\\\\"link\\\\\\\" our `movies` table.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table categories (\\\\n  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,\\\\n  name text -- category name\\\\n);\\\\n\\\\nalter table movies\\\\n  add column category_id bigint references categories;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can also create \\\\\\\"many-to-many\\\\\\\" relationships by creating a \\\\\\\"join\\\\\\\" table.\\\\nFor example if you had the following situations:\\\\n\\\\n*   You have a list of `movies`.\\\\n*   A movie can have several `actors`.\\\\n*   An `actor` can perform in several movies.\\\\n\\\\n<Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"dashboard\\\\\\\" queryGroup=\\\\\\\"database-method\\\\\\\">\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"dashboard\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Dashboard\\\\\\\">\\\\n    <div className=\\\\\\\"video-container\\\\\\\">\\\\n      <iframe src=\\\\\\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TKwF3IGij5c\\\\\\\" frameBorder=\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\" allow=\\\\\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\\\\\" allowFullScreen />\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"sql\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"SQL\\\\\\\">\\\\n    ```sql\\\\n    create table movies (\\\\n      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,\\\\n      name text,\\\\n      description text\\\\n    );\\\\n\\\\n    create table actors (\\\\n      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,\\\\n      name text\\\\n    );\\\\n\\\\n    create table performances (\\\\n      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,\\\\n      movie_id bigint not null references movies,\\\\n      actor_id bigint not null references actors\\\\n    );\\\\n    ```\\\\n  </TabPanel>\\\\n</Tabs>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Schemas\\\\n\\\\nTables belong to `schemas`. Schemas are a way of organizing your tables, often for security reasons.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Schemas and tables\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/database/managing-tables/schemas.png',\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/database/managing-tables/schemas--light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\nIf you don't explicitly pass a schema when creating a table, Postgres will assume that you want to create the table in the `public` schema.\\\\n\\\\nWe can create schemas for organizing tables. For example, we might want a private schema which is hidden from our API:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate schema private;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow we can create tables inside the `private` schema:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table private.salaries (\\\\n  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,\\\\n  salary bigint not null,\\\\n  actor_id bigint not null references public.actors\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Views\\\\n\\\\nA View is a convenient shortcut to a query. Creating a view does not involve new tables or data. When run, an underlying query is executed, returning its results to the user.\\\\n\\\\nSay we have the following tables from a database of a university:\\\\n\\\\n**`students`**\\\\n\\\\n{/* supa-mdx-lint-disable Rule003Spelling */}\\\\n\\\\n| id | name             | type          |\\\\n| -- | ---------------- | ------------- |\\\\n| 1  | Princess Leia    | undergraduate |\\\\n| 2  | Yoda             | graduate      |\\\\n| 3  | Anakin Skywalker | graduate      |\\\\n\\\\n{/* supa-mdx-lint-enable Rule003Spelling */}\\\\n\\\\n**`courses`**\\\\n\\\\n| id | title                    | code    |\\\\n| -- | ------------------------ | ------- |\\\\n| 1  | Introduction to Postgres | PG101   |\\\\n| 2  | Authentication Theories  | AUTH205 |\\\\n| 3  | Fundamentals of Supabase | SUP412  |\\\\n\\\\n**`grades`**\\\\n\\\\n| id | student\\\\\\\\_id | course\\\\\\\\_id | result |\\\\n| -- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |\\\\n| 1  | 1           | 1          | B+     |\\\\n| 2  | 1           | 3          | A+     |\\\\n| 3  | 2           | 2          | A      |\\\\n| 4  | 3           | 1          | A-     |\\\\n| 5  | 3           | 2          | A      |\\\\n| 6  | 3           | 3          | B-     |\\\\n\\\\nCreating a view consisting of all the three tables will look like this:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate view transcripts as\\\\n    select\\\\n        students.name,\\\\n        students.type,\\\\n        courses.title,\\\\n        courses.code,\\\\n        grades.result\\\\n    from grades\\\\n    left join students on grades.student_id = students.id\\\\n    left join courses on grades.course_id = courses.id;\\\\n\\\\ngrant all on table transcripts to authenticated;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nOnce done, we can now access the underlying query with:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect * from transcripts;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### View security\\\\n\\\\nBy default, views are accessed with their creator's permission (\\\\\\\"security definer\\\\\\\"). If a privileged role creates a view, others accessing it will use that role's elevated permissions. To enforce row level security policies, define the view with the \\\\\\\"security invoker\\\\\\\" modifier.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- alter a security_definer view to be security_invoker\\\\nalter view <view name>\\\\nset (security_invoker = true);\\\\n\\\\n-- create a view with the security_invoker modifier\\\\ncreate view <view name> with(security_invoker=true) as (\\\\n  select * from <some table>\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### When to use views\\\\n\\\\nViews provide several benefits:\\\\n\\\\n*   Simplicity\\\\n*   Consistency\\\\n*   Logical Organization\\\\n*   Security\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Simplicity\\\\n\\\\nAs a query becomes more complex, it can be a hassle to call it over and over - especially when we run it regularly. In the example above, instead of repeatedly running:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  students.name,\\\\n  students.type,\\\\n  courses.title,\\\\n  courses.code,\\\\n  grades.result\\\\nfrom\\\\n  grades\\\\n  left join students on grades.student_id = students.id\\\\n  left join courses on grades.course_id = courses.id;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe can run this instead:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect * from transcripts;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, a view behaves like a typical table. We can safely use it in table `JOIN`s or even create new views using existing views.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Consistency\\\\n\\\\nViews ensure that the likelihood of mistakes decreases when repeatedly executing a query. In our example above, we may decide that we want to exclude the course *Introduction to Postgres*. The query would become:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  students.name,\\\\n  students.type,\\\\n  courses.title,\\\\n  courses.code,\\\\n  grades.result\\\\nfrom\\\\n  grades\\\\n  left join students on grades.student_id = students.id\\\\n  left join courses on grades.course_id = courses.id\\\\nwhere courses.code != 'PG101';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWithout a view, we would need to go into every dependent query to add the new rule. This would increase in the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies, as well as introducing a lot of effort for a developer. With views, we can alter just the underlying query in the view **transcripts**. The change will be applied to all applications using this view.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Logical organization\\\\n\\\\nWith views, we can give our query a name. This is extremely useful for teams working with the same database. Instead of guessing what a query is supposed to do, a well-named view can explain it. For example, by looking at the name of the view **transcripts**, we can infer that the underlying query might involve the **students**, **courses**, and **grades** tables.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Security\\\\n\\\\nViews can restrict the amount and type of data presented to a user. Instead of allowing a user direct access to a set of tables, we provide them a view instead. We can prevent them from reading sensitive columns by excluding them from the underlying query.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Materialized views\\\\n\\\\nA [materialized view](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/rules-materializedviews.html) is a form of view but it also stores the results to disk. In subsequent reads of a materialized view, the time taken to return its results would be much faster than a conventional view. This is because the data is readily available for a materialized view while the conventional view executes the underlying query each time it is called.\\\\n\\\\nUsing our example above, a materialized view can be created like this:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate materialized view transcripts as\\\\n  select\\\\n    students.name,\\\\n    students.type,\\\\n    courses.title,\\\\n    courses.code,\\\\n    grades.result\\\\n  from\\\\n    grades\\\\n    left join students on grades.student_id = students.id\\\\n    left join courses on grades.course_id = courses.id;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nReading from the materialized view is the same as a conventional view:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect * from transcripts;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Refreshing materialized views\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, there is a trade-off - data in materialized views are not always up to date. We need to refresh it regularly to prevent the data from becoming too stale. To do so:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nrefresh materialized view transcripts;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIt's up to you how regularly refresh your materialized views, and it's probably different for each view depending on its use-case.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Materialized views vs conventional views\\\\n\\\\nMaterialized views are useful when execution times for queries or views are too slow. These could likely occur in views or queries involving multiple tables and billions of rows. When using such a view, however, there should be tolerance towards data being outdated. Some use-cases for materialized views are internal dashboards and analytics.\\\\n\\\\nCreating a materialized view is not a solution to inefficient queries. You should always seek to optimize a slow running query even if you are implementing a materialized view.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Resources\\\\n\\\\n*   [Official Docs: Create table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html)\\\\n*   [Official Docs: Create view](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html)\\\\n*   [Postgres Tutorial: Create tables](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-create-table/)\\\\n*   [Postgres Tutorial: Add column](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-add-column/)\\\\n*   [Postgres Tutorial: Views](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-views/)\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Querying Joins and Nested tables\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Querying Joins and Nested tables\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe data APIs automatically detect relationships between Postgres tables.

factors can contribute. Some of the most common causes of poor performance include:\\\\n\\\\n*   An inefficiently designed schema\\\\n*   Inefficiently designed queries\\\\n*   A lack of indexes causing slower than required queries over large tables\\\\n*   Unused indexes causing slow `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations\\\\n*   Not enough compute resources, such as memory, causing your database to go to disk for results too often\\\\n*   Lock contention from multiple queries operating on highly utilized tables\\\\n*   Large amount of bloat on your tables causing poor query planning\\\\n\\\\nYou can examine your database and queries for these issues using either the [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) or SQL.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Using the CLI\\\\n\\\\nThe Supabase CLI comes with a range of tools to help inspect your Postgres instances for potential issues. The CLI gets the information from <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/internals.html\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\">Postgres internals</a>. Therefore, most tools provided are compatible with any Postgres databases regardless if they are a Supabase project or not.\\\\n\\\\nYou can find installation instructions for the Supabase CLI <a href=\\\\\\\"/docs/guides/cli\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\">here</a>.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### The `inspect db` command\\\\n\\\\nThe inspection tools for your Postgres database are under the `inspect db` command. You can get a full list of available commands by running `supabase inspect db help`.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n$ supabase inspect db help\\\\nTools to inspect your Supabase database\\\\n\\\\nUsage:\\\\n  supabase inspect db [command]\\\\n\\\\nAvailable Commands:\\\\n  bloat                Estimates space allocated to a relation that is full of dead tuples\\\\n  blocking             Show queries that are holding locks and the queries that are waiting for them to be released\\\\n  cache-hit            Show cache hit rates for tables and indices\\\\n\\\\n...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Connect to any Postgres database\\\\n\\\\nMost inspection commands are Postgres agnostic. You can run inspection routines on any Postgres database even if it is not a Supabase project by providing a connection string via `--db-url`.\\\\n\\\\nFor example you can connect to your local Postgres instance:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nsupabase --db-url postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres inspect db bloat\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Connect to a Supabase instance\\\\n\\\\nWorking with Supabase, you can link the Supabase CLI with your project:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nsupabase link --project-ref <project-id>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen the CLI will automatically connect to your Supabase project whenever you are in the project folder and you no longer need to provide `\\u2014db-url`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Inspection commands\\\\n\\\\nBelow are the `db` inspection commands provided, grouped by different use cases.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Some commands might require `pg_stat_statements` to be enabled or a specific Postgres version to be used.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Disk storage\\\\n\\\\nThese commands are handy if you are running low on disk storage:\\\\n\\\\n*   [bloat](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-bloat) - estimates the amount of wasted space\\\\n*   [vacuum-stats](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-vacuum-stats) - gives information on waste collection routines\\\\n*   [table-record-counts](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-table-record-counts) - estimates the number of records per table\\\\n*   [table-sizes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-table-sizes) - shows the sizes of tables\\\\n*   [index-sizes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-index-sizes) - shows the sizes of individual index\\\\n*   [table-index-sizes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-table-index-sizes) - shows the sizes of indexes for each table\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Query performance\\\\n\\\\nThe commands below are useful if your Postgres database consumes a lot of resources like CPU, RAM or Disk IO. You can also use them to investigate slow queries.\\\\n\\\\n*   [cache-hit](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-cache-hit) - shows how efficient your cache usage is overall\\\\n*   [unused-indexes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-unused-indexes) - shows indexes with low index scans\\\\n*   [index-usage](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-index-usage) - shows information about the efficiency of indexes\\\\n*   [seq-scans](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-seq-scans) - show number of sequential scans recorded against all tables\\\\n*   [long-running-queries](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-long-running-queries) - shows long running queries that are executing right now\\\\n*   [outliers](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-outliers) - shows queries with high execution time but low call count and queries with high proportion of execution time spent on synchronous I/O\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Locks\\\\n\\\\n*   [locks](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-locks) - shows statements which have taken out an exclusive lock on a relation\\\\n*   [blocking](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-blocking) - shows statements that are waiting for locks to be released\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Connections\\\\n\\\\n*   [role-connections](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-role-connections) - shows number of active connections for all database roles (Supabase-specific command)\\\\n*   [replication-slots](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-replication-slots) - shows information about replication slots on the database\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Notes on `pg_stat_statements`\\\\n\\\\nFollowing commands require `pg_stat_statements` to be enabled: calls, locks, cache-hit, blocking, unused-indexes, index-usage, bloat, outliers, table-record-counts, replication-slots, seq-scans, vacuum-stats, long-running-queries.\\\\n\\\\nWhen using `pg_stat_statements` also take note that it only stores the latest 5,000 statements. Moreover, consider resetting the analysis after optimizing any queries by running `select pg_stat_statements_reset();`\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about pg\\\\\\\\_stats [here](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_stat_statements).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Using SQL\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\">\\\\n  If you're seeing an `insufficient privilege` error when viewing the Query Performance page from the dashboard, run this command:\\\\n\\\\n  ```shell\\\\n  $ grant pg_read_all_stats to postgres;\\\\n  ```\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Postgres cumulative statistics system\\\\n\\\\nPostgres collects data about its own operations using the [cumulative statistics system](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html). In addition to this, every Supabase project has the [pg\\\\\\\\_stat\\\\\\\\_statements extension](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_stat_statements) enabled by default. This extension records query execution performance details and is the best way to find inefficient queries. This information can be combined with the Postgres query plan analyzer to develop more efficient queries.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some example queries to get you started.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Most frequently called queries\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  auth.rolname,\\\\n  statements.query,\\\\n  statements.calls,\\\\n  -- -- Postgres 13, 14, 15\\\\n  statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time as total_time,\\\\n  statements.min_exec_time + statements.min_plan_time as min_time,\\\\n  statements.max_exec_time + statements.max_plan_time as max_time,\\\\n  statements.mean_exec_time + statements.mean_plan_time as mean_time,\\\\n  -- -- Postgres <= 12\\\\n  -- total_time,\\\\n  -- min_time,\\\\n  -- max_time,\\\\n  -- mean_time,\\\\n  statements.rows / statements.calls as avg_rows\\\\nfrom\\\\n  pg_stat_statements as statements\\\\n  inner join pg_authid as auth on statements.userid = auth.oid\\\\norder by statements.calls desc\\\\nlimit 100;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query shows:\\\\n\\\\n*   query statistics, ordered by the number of times each query has been executed\\\\n*   the role that ran the query\\\\n*   the number of times it has been called\\\\n*   the average number of rows returned\\\\n*   the cumulative total time the query has spent running\\\\n*   the min, max and mean query times.\\\\n\\\\nThis provides useful information about the queries you run most frequently. Queries that have high `max_time` or `mean_time` times and are being called often can be good candidates for optimization.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Slowest queries by execution time\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  auth.rolname,\\\\n  statements.query,\\\\n  statements.calls,\\\\n  -- -- Postgres 13, 14, 15\\\\n  statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time as total_time,\\\\n  statements.min_exec_time + statements.min_plan_time as min_time,\\\\n  statements.max_exec_time + statements.max_plan_time as max_time,\\\\n  statements.mean_exec_time + statements.mean_plan_time as mean_time,\\\\n  -- -- Postgres <= 12\\\\n  -- total_time,\\\\n  -- min_time,\\\\n  -- max_time,\\\\n  -- mean_time,\\\\n  statements.rows / statements.calls as avg_rows\\\\nfrom\\\\n  pg_stat_statements as statements\\\\n  inner join pg_authid as auth on statements.userid = auth.oid\\\\norder by max_time desc\\\\nlimit 100;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query will show you statistics about queries ordered by the maximum execution time. It is similar to the query above ordered by calls, but this one highlights outliers that may have high executions times. Queries which have high or mean execution times are good candidates for optimization.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Most time consuming queries\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  auth.rolname,\\\\n  statements.query,\\\\n  statements.calls,\\\\n  statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time as total_time,\\\\n  to_char(\\\\n    (\\\\n      (statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time) / sum(\\\\n        statements.total_exec_time + statements.total_plan_time\\\\n      ) over ()\\\\n    ) * 100,\\\\n    'FM90D0'\\\\n  ) || '%' as prop_total_time\\\\nfrom\\\\n  pg_stat_statements as statements\\\\n  inner join pg_authid as auth on statements.userid = auth.oid\\\\norder by total_time desc\\\\nlimit 100;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query will show you statistics about queries ordered by the cumulative total execution time. It shows the total time the query has spent running as well as the proportion of total execution time the query has taken up.\\\\n\\\\nQueries which are the most time consuming are not necessarily bad, you may have a very efficient and frequently ran queries that end up taking a large total % time, but it can be useful to help spot queries that are taking up more time than they should.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Hit rate\\\\n\\\\nGenerally for most applications a small percentage of data is accessed more regularly than the rest. To make sure that your regularly accessed data is available, Postgres tracks your data access patterns and keeps this in its [shared\\\\\\\\_buffers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-MEMORY) cache.\\\\n\\\\nApplications with lower cache hit rates generally perform more poorly since they have to hit the disk to get results rather than serving them from memory. Very poor hit rates can also cause you to burst past your [Disk IO limits](./compute-add-ons#disk-io) causing significant performance issues.\\\\n\\\\nYou can view your cache and index hit rate by executing the following query:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  'index hit rate' as name,\\\\n  (sum(idx_blks_hit)) / nullif(sum(idx_blks_hit + idx_blks_read), 0) * 100 as ratio\\\\nfrom pg_statio_user_indexes\\\\nunion all\\\\nselect\\\\n  'table hit rate' as name,\\\\n  sum(heap_blks_hit) / nullif(sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read), 0) * 100 as ratio\\\\nfrom pg_statio_user_tables;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis shows the ratio of data blocks fetched from the Postgres [shared\\\\\\\\_buffers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-MEMORY) cache against the data blocks that were read from disk/OS cache.\\\\n\\\\nIf either of your index or table hit rate are \\\\\\\\< 99% then this can indicate your compute plan is too small for your current workload and you would benefit from more memory. [Upgrading your compute](./compute-add-ons) is easy and can be done from your [project dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/settings/compute-and-disk).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Optimizing poor performing queries\\\\n\\\\nPostgres has built in tooling to help you optimize poorly performing queries. You can use the [query plan analyzer](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) on any expensive queries that you have identified:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nexplain analyze <query-statement-here>;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhen you include `analyze` in the explain statement, the database attempts to execute the query and provides a detailed query plan along with actual execution times. So, be careful using `explain analyze` with `insert`/`update`/`delete` queries, because the query will actually run, and could have unintended side-effects.\\\\n\\\\nIf you run just `explain` without the `analyze` keyword, the database will only perform query planning without actually executing the query. This approach can be beneficial when you want to inspect the query plan without affecting the database or if you encounter timeouts in your queries.\\\\n\\\\nUsing the query plan analyzer to optimize your queries is a large topic, with a number of online resources available:\\\\n\\\\n*   [Official docs.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html)\\\\n    {/* supa-mdx-lint-disable-next-line Rule004ExcludeWords */}\\\\n*   [The Art of PostgreSQL.](https://theartofpostgresql.com/explain-plan-visualizer/)\\\\n*   [Postgres Wiki.](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Using_EXPLAIN)\\\\n*   [Enterprise DB.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/postgresql-query-optimization-performance-tuning-with-explain-analyze)\\\\n\\\\nYou can pair the information available from `pg_stat_statements` with the detailed system metrics available [via your metrics endpoint](../platform/metrics) to better understand the behavior of your DB and the queries you're executing against it.\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Vector search with Next.js and OpenAI\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Vector search with Next.js and OpenAI\\\\n\\\\nLearn how to build a ChatGPT-style doc search powered by Next.js, OpenAI, and Supabase.\\\\n\\\\nWhile our [Headless Vector search](/docs/guides/ai/examples/headless-vector-search) provides a toolkit for generative Q\\\\\\\\&A, in this tutorial we'll go more in-depth, build a custom ChatGPT-like search experience from the ground-up using Next.js.

The SQL included in this guide is applicable for clients in all programming languages. If you are a Python user see your [Python client options](/docs/guides/ai/python-clients) after reading the `Learn` section.\\\\n\\\\nVectors in Supabase are enabled via [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/), a Postgres extension for storing and querying vectors in Postgres. It can be used to store [embeddings](/docs/guides/ai/concepts#what-are-embeddings).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Usage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Enable the extension\\\\n\\\\n<Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"dashboard\\\\\\\" queryGroup=\\\\\\\"database-method\\\\\\\">\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"dashboard\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Dashboard\\\\\\\">\\\\n    1.

The size of the vector (indicated in parenthesis) represents the number of dimensions stored in that vector.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table documents (\\\\n  id serial primary key,\\\\n  title text not null,\\\\n  body text not null,\\\\n  embedding extensions.vector(384)\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn the above SQL snippet, we create a `documents` table with a column called `embedding` (note this is just a regular Postgres column - you can name it whatever you like). We give the `embedding` column a `vector` data type with 384 dimensions. Change this to the number of dimensions produced by your embedding model. For example, if you are [generating embeddings](/docs/guides/ai/quickstarts/generate-text-embeddings) using the open source [`gte-small`](https://huggingface.co/Supabase/gte-small) model, you would set this number to 384 since that model produces 384 dimensions.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"tip\\\\\\\">\\\\n  In general, embeddings with fewer dimensions perform best. See our [analysis on fewer dimensions in pgvector](/blog/fewer-dimensions-are-better-pgvector).\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Storing a vector / embedding\\\\n\\\\nIn this example we'll generate a vector using Transformers.js, then store it in the database using the Supabase JavaScript client.\\\\n\\\\n```js\\\\nimport { pipeline } from '@xenova/transformers'\\\\nconst generateEmbedding = await pipeline('feature-extraction', 'Supabase/gte-small')\\\\n\\\\nconst title = 'First post!'\\\\nconst body = 'Hello world!'\\\\n\\\\n// Generate a vector using Transformers.js\\\\nconst output = await generateEmbedding(body, {\\\\n  pooling: 'mean',\\\\n  normalize: true,\\\\n})\\\\n\\\\n// Extract the embedding output\\\\nconst embedding = Array.from(output.data)\\\\n\\\\n// Store the vector in Postgres\\\\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.from('documents').insert({\\\\n  title,\\\\n  body,\\\\n  embedding,\\\\n})\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis example uses the JavaScript Supabase client, but you can modify it to work with any [supported language library](/docs#client-libraries).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Querying a vector / embedding\\\\n\\\\nSimilarity search is the most common use case for vectors. `pgvector` support 3 new operators for computing distance:\\\\n\\\\n| Operator | Description            |\\\\n| -------- | ---------------------- |\\\\n| `<->`    | Euclidean distance     |\\\\n| `<#>`    | negative inner product |\\\\n| `<=>`    | cosine distance        |\\\\n\\\\nChoosing the right operator depends on your needs. Dot product tends to be the fastest if your vectors are normalized. For more information on how embeddings work and how they relate to each other, see [What are Embeddings?](/docs/guides/ai/concepts#what-are-embeddings).\\\\n\\\\nSupabase client libraries like `supabase-js` connect to your Postgres instance via [PostgREST](/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture#postgrest-api). PostgREST does not currently support `pgvector` similarity operators, so we'll need to wrap our query in a Postgres function and call it via the `rpc()` method:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate or replace function match_documents (\\\\n  query_embedding extensions.vector(384),\\\\n  match_threshold float,\\\\n  match_count int\\\\n)\\\\nreturns table (\\\\n  id bigint,\\\\n  title text,\\\\n  body text,\\\\n  similarity float\\\\n)\\\\nlanguage sql stable\\\\nas $$\\\\n  select\\\\n    documents.id,\\\\n    documents.title,\\\\n    documents.body,\\\\n    1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity\\\\n  from documents\\\\n  where 1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) > match_threshold\\\\n  order by (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) asc\\\\n  limit match_count;\\\\n$$;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis function takes a `query_embedding` argument and compares it to all other embeddings in the `documents` table. Each comparison returns a similarity score. If the similarity is greater than the `match_threshold` argument, it is returned. The number of rows returned is limited by the `match_count` argument.\\\\n\\\\nFeel free to modify this method to fit the needs of your application. The `match_threshold` ensures that only documents that have a minimum similarity to the `query_embedding` are returned. Without this, you may end up returning documents that subjectively don't match. This value will vary for each application - you will need to perform your own testing to determine the threshold that makes sense for your app.\\\\n\\\\nIf you index your vector column, ensure that the `order by` sorts by the distance function directly (rather than sorting by the calculated `similarity` column, which may lead to the index being ignored and poor performance).\\\\n\\\\nTo execute the function from your client library, call `rpc()` with the name of your Postgres function:\\\\n\\\\n```ts\\\\nconst { data: documents } = await supabaseClient.rpc('match_documents', {\\\\n  query_embedding: embedding, // Pass the embedding you want to compare\\\\n  match_threshold: 0.78, // Choose an appropriate threshold for your data\\\\n  match_count: 10, // Choose the number of matches\\\\n})\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this example `embedding` would be another embedding you wish to compare against your table of pre-generated embedding documents. For example if you were building a search engine, every time the user submits their query you would first generate an embedding on the search query itself, then pass it into the above `rpc()` function to match.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"tip\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Be sure to use embeddings produced from the same embedding model when calculating distance. Comparing embeddings from two different models will produce no meaningful result.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\nVectors and embeddings can be used for much more than search. Learn more about embeddings at [What are Embeddings?](/docs/guides/ai/concepts#what-are-embeddings).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Indexes\\\\n\\\\nOnce your vector table starts to grow, you will likely want to add an index to speed up queries. See [Vector indexes](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes) to learn how vector indexes work and how to create them.\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Show combined table size, index size, and estimated row count\\\\n\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# CLI Reference\\\\n\\\\nShow combined table size, index size, and estimated row count\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsupabase inspect db table-stats\\\\n\\\\nCLI Reference for Show sizes of individual tables:\\\\n{\\\\\\\"summary\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Show combined table size, index size, and estimated row count\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"usage\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"supabase inspect db table-stats\\\\\\\"}\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Query Optimization\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Query Optimization\\\\n\\\\nChoosing indexes to improve your query performance.\\\\n\\\\nWhen working with Postgres, or any relational database, indexing is key to improving query performance. Aligning indexes with common query patterns can speed up data retrieval by an order of magnitude.\\\\n\\\\nThis guide is intended to:\\\\n\\\\n*   help identify parts of a query that have the potential to be improved by indexes\\\\n*   introduce tooling to help identify useful indexes\\\\n\\\\nThis is not a comprehensive resource, but rather a helpful starting point for your optimization journey.\\\\n\\\\nIf you're new to query optimization, you may be interested in [`index_advisor`](/docs/guides/database/extensions/index_advisor), our tool for automatically detecting indexes that improve performance on a given query.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Example query\\\\n\\\\nConsider the following example query that retrieves customer names and purchase dates from two tables:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  a.name,\\\\n  b.date_of_purchase\\\\nfrom\\\\n  customers as a\\\\n  join orders as b on a.id = b.customer_id\\\\nwhere a.sign_up_date > '2023-01-01' and b.status = 'shipped'\\\\norder by b.date_of_purchase\\\\nlimit 10;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this query, there are several parts that indexes could likely help in optimizing the performance:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### `where` clause:\\\\n\\\\nThe `where` clause filters rows based on certain conditions, and indexing the columns involved can improve this process:\\\\n\\\\n*   `a.sign_up_date`: If filtering by `sign_up_date` is common, indexing this column can speed up the query.\\\\n*   `b.status`: Indexing the status may be beneficial if the column has diverse values.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_customers_sign_up_date on customers (sign_up_date);\\\\n\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_status on orders (status);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### `join` columns\\\\n\\\\nIndexes on the columns used for joining tables can help Postgres avoid scanning tables in their entirety when connecting tables.\\\\n\\\\n*   Indexing `a.id` and `b.customer_id` would likely improve the performance of the join in this query.\\\\n*   Note that if `a.id` is the primary key of the `customers` table it is already indexed\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_customer_id on orders (customer_id);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### `order by` clause\\\\n\\\\nSorting can also be optimized by indexing:\\\\n\\\\n*   An index on `b.date_of_purchase` can improve the sorting process, and is particularly beneficial when a subset of rows is being returned with a `limit` clause.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_date_of_purchase on orders (date_of_purchase);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Key concepts\\\\n\\\\nHere are some concepts and tools to keep in mind to help you identify the best index for the job, and measure the impact that your index had:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Analyze the query plan\\\\n\\\\nUse the `explain` command to understand the query's execution. Look for slow parts, such as Sequential Scans or high cost numbers. If creating an index does not reduce the cost of the query plan, remove it.\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nexplain select * from customers where sign_up_date > 25;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Use appropriate index types\\\\n\\\\nPostgres offers various index types like [B-tree, Hash, GIN, etc](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html). Select the type that best suits your data and query pattern. Using the right index type can make a significant difference. For example, using a BRIN index on a field that always increases and lives within a table that updates infrequently - like `created_at` on an `orders` table - routinely results in indexes that are +10x smaller than the equivalent default B-tree index. That translates into better scalability.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_created_at ON customers using brin(created_at);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Partial indexes\\\\n\\\\nFor queries that frequently target a subset of data, a partial index could be faster and smaller than indexing the entire column. A partial index contains a `where` clause to filter the values included in the index. Note that a query's `where` clause must match the index for it to be used.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_orders_status on orders (status)\\\\nwhere status = 'shipped';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Composite indexes\\\\n\\\\nIf filtering or joining on multiple columns, a composite index prevents Postgres from referring to multiple indexes when identifying the relevant rows.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate index idx_customers_sign_up_date_priority on customers (sign_up_date, priority);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Over-Indexing\\\\n\\\\nAvoid the urge to index columns you operate on infrequently. While indexes can speed up reads, they also slow down writes, so it's important to balance those factors when making indexing decisions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Statistics\\\\n\\\\nPostgres maintains a set of statistics about the contents of your tables. Those statistics are used by the query planner to decide when it's is more efficient to use an index vs scanning the entire table. If the collected statistics drift too far from reality, the query planner may make poor decisions. To avoid this risk, you can periodically `analyze` tables.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nanalyze customers;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\\nBy following this guide, you'll be able to discern where indexes can optimize queries and enhance your Postgres performance. Remember that each database is unique, so always consider the specific context and use case of your queries.\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Error Codes\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Error

For example, if a user searches for \\\\\\\"Italian recipes with tomato sauce\\\\\\\" on a cooking app, a keyword search would pull up recipes that specifically mention \\\\\\\"Italian,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"recipes,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"tomato sauce\\\\\\\" in the text. However, it might miss out on dishes that are quintessentially Italian and use tomato sauce but don't explicitly label themselves with these words, or use variations like \\\\\\\"pasta sauce\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"marinara.\\\\\\\" On the other hand, a semantic search might understand the culinary context and find recipes that match the intent, such as a traditional \\\\\\\"Spaghetti Marinara,\\\\\\\" even if they don't match the exact keyword phrase. However, it could also suggest recipes that are contextually related but not what the user is looking for, like a \\\\\\\"Mexican salsa\\\\\\\" recipe, because it understands the context to be broadly about tomato-based sauces.\\\\n\\\\nHybrid search combines the strengths of both these methods. It would ensure that recipes explicitly mentioning the keywords are prioritized, thus capturing direct hits that satisfy the keyword criteria. At the same time, it would include recipes identified through semantic understanding as being related in meaning or context, like different Italian dishes that traditionally use tomato sauce but might not have been tagged explicitly with the user's search terms. It identifies results that are both directly and contextually relevant to the user's query while ideally minimizing misses and irrelevant suggestions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## When to consider hybrid search\\\\n\\\\nThe decision to use hybrid search depends on what your users are looking for in your app. For a code repository where developers need to find exact lines of code or error messages, keyword search is likely ideal because it matches specific terms. In a mental health forum where users search for advice or experiences related to their feelings, semantic search may be better because it finds results based on the meaning of a query, not just specific words. For a shopping app where customers might search for specific product names yet also be open to related suggestions, hybrid search combines the best of both worlds - finding exact matches while also uncovering similar products based on the shopping context.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## How to combine search methods\\\\n\\\\nHybrid search merges keyword search and semantic search, but how does this process work?\\\\n\\\\nFirst, each search method is executed separately. Keyword search, which involves searching by specific words or phrases present in the content, will yield its own set of results. Similarly, semantic search, which involves understanding the context or meaning behind the search query rather than the specific words used, will generate its own unique results.\\\\n\\\\nNow with these separate result lists available, the next step is to combine them into a single, unified list. This is achieved through a process known as \\u201cfusion\\u201d. Fusion takes the results from both search methods and merges them together based on a certain ranking or scoring system. This system may prioritize certain results based on factors like their relevance to the search query, their ranking in the individual lists, or other criteria. The result is a final list that integrates the strengths of both keyword and semantic search methods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Reciprocal Ranked Fusion (RRF)\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most common fusion methods is Reciprocal Ranked Fusion (RRF). The key idea behind RRF is to give more weight to the top-ranked items in each individual result list when building the final combined list.\\\\n\\\\nIn RRF, we iterate over each record and assign a score (noting that each record could exist in one or both lists). The score is calculated as 1 divided by that record's rank in each list, summed together between both lists. For example, if a record with an ID of `123` was ranked third in the keyword search and ninth in semantic search, it would receive a score of $$\\\\\\\\dfrac{1}{3} + \\\\\\\\dfrac{1}{9} = 0.444$$. If the record was found in only one list and not the other, it would receive a score of 0 for the other list. The records are then sorted by this score to create the final list. The items with the highest scores are ranked first, and lowest scores ranked last.\\\\n\\\\nThis method ensures that items that are ranked high in multiple lists are given a high rank in the final list. It also ensures that items that are ranked high in only a few lists but low in others are not given a high rank in the final list. Placing the rank in the denominator when calculating score helps penalize the low ranking records.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Smoothing constant `k`\\\\n\\\\nTo prevent extremely high scores for items that are ranked first (since we're dividing by the rank), a `k` constant is often added to the denominator to smooth the score:\\\\n\\\\n$$\\\\\\\\dfrac{1}{k+rank}$$\\\\n\\\\nThis constant can be any positive number, but is typically small. A constant of 1 would mean that a record ranked first would have a score of $$\\\\\\\\dfrac{1}{1+1} = 0.5$$ instead of $$1$$. This adjustment can help balance the influence of items that are ranked very high in individual lists when creating the final combined list.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Hybrid search in Postgres\\\\n\\\\nLet's implement hybrid search in Postgres using `tsvector` (keyword search) and `pgvector` (semantic search).\\\\n\\\\nFirst we'll create a `documents` table to store the documents that we will search over. This is just an example - adjust this to match the structure of your application.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table documents (\\\\n  id bigint primary key generated always as identity,\\\\n  content text,\\\\n  fts tsvector generated always as (to_tsvector('english', content)) stored,\\\\n  embedding extensions.vector(512)\\\\n);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe table contains 4 columns:\\\\n\\\\n*   `id` is an auto-generated unique ID for the record. We'll use this later to match records when performing RRF.\\\\n*   `content` contains the actual text we will be searching over.\\\\n*   `fts` is an auto-generated `tsvector` column that is generated using the text in `content`. We will use this for [full text search](/docs/guides/database/full-text-search) (search by keyword).\\\\n*   `embedding` is a [vector column](/docs/guides/ai/vector-columns) that stores the vector generated from our embedding model. We will use this for [semantic search](/docs/guides/ai/semantic-search) (search by meaning). We chose 512 dimensions for this example, but adjust this to match the size of the embedding vectors generated from your preferred model.\\\\n\\\\nNext we'll create indexes on the `fts` and `embedding` columns so that their individual queries will remain fast at scale:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Create an index for the full-text search\\\\ncreate index on documents using gin(fts);\\\\n\\\\n-- Create an index for the semantic vector search\\\\ncreate index on documents using hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor full text search we use a [generalized inverted (GIN) index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin.html) which is designed for handling composite values like those stored in a `tsvector`.\\\\n\\\\nFor semantic vector search we use an [HNSW index](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes/hnsw-indexes), which is a high performing approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithm. Note that we are using the `vector_ip_ops` (inner product) operator with this index because we plan on using the inner product (`<#>`) operator later in our query. If you plan to use a different operator like cosine distance (`<=>`), be sure to update the index accordingly. For more information, see [distance operators](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes#distance-operators).\\\\n\\\\nFinally we'll create our `hybrid_search` function:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate or replace function hybrid_search(\\\\n  query_text text,\\\\n  query_embedding extensions.vector(512),\\\\n  match_count int,\\\\n  full_text_weight float = 1,\\\\n  semantic_weight float = 1,\\\\n  rrf_k int = 50\\\\n)\\\\nreturns setof documents\\\\nlanguage sql\\\\nas $$\\\\nwith full_text as (\\\\n  select\\\\n    id,\\\\n    -- Note: ts_rank_cd is not indexable but will only rank matches of the where clause\\\\n    -- which shouldn't be too big\\\\n    row_number() over(order by ts_rank_cd(fts, websearch_to_tsquery(query_text)) desc) as rank_ix\\\\n  from\\\\n    documents\\\\n  where\\\\n    fts @@ websearch_to_tsquery(query_text)\\\\n  order by rank_ix\\\\n  limit least(match_count, 30) * 2\\\\n),\\\\nsemantic as (\\\\n  select\\\\n    id,\\\\n    row_number() over (order by embedding <#> query_embedding) as rank_ix\\\\n  from\\\\n    documents\\\\n  order by rank_ix\\\\n  limit least(match_count, 30) * 2\\\\n)\\\\nselect\\\\n  documents.*\\\\nfrom\\\\n  full_text\\\\n  full outer join semantic\\\\n    on full_text.id = semantic.id\\\\n  join documents\\\\n    on coalesce(full_text.id, semantic.id) = documents.id\\\\norder by\\\\n  coalesce(1.0 / (rrf_k + full_text.rank_ix), 0.0) * full_text_weight +\\\\n  coalesce(1.0 / (rrf_k + semantic.rank_ix), 0.0) * semantic_weight\\\\n  desc\\\\nlimit\\\\n  least(match_count, 30)\\\\n$$;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nLet's break this down:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Parameters:** The function accepts quite a few parameters, but the main (required) ones are `query_text`, `query_embedding`, and `match_count`.\\\\n\\\\n    *   `query_text` is the user's query text (more on this shortly)\\\\n    *   `query_embedding` is the vector representation of the user's query produced by the embedding model. We chose 512 dimensions for this example, but adjust this to match the size of the embedding vectors generated from your preferred model. This must match the size of the `embedding` vector on the `documents` table (and use the same model).\\\\n    *   `match_count` is the number of records returned in the `limit` clause.\\\\n\\\\n    The other parameters are optional, but give more control over the fusion process.\\\\n\\\\n    *   `full_text_weight` and `semantic_weight` decide how much weight each search method gets in the final score. These are both 1 by default which means they both equally contribute towards the final rank. A `full_text_weight` of 2 and `semantic_weight` of 1 would give full-text search twice as much weight as semantic search.\\\\n    *   `rrf_k` is the `k` [smoothing constant](#smoothing-constant-k) added to the reciprocal rank. The default is 50.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Return type:** The function returns a set of records from our `documents` table.\\\\n\\\\n*   **CTE:** We create two [common table expressions (CTE)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html), one for full-text search and one for semantic search. These perform each query individually prior to joining them.\\\\n\\\\n*   **RRF:** The final query combines the results from the two CTEs using [reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)](#reciprocal-ranked-fusion-rrf).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Running hybrid search\\\\n\\\\nTo use this function in SQL, we can run:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  *\\\\nfrom\\\\n  hybrid_search(\\\\n    'Italian recipes with tomato sauce', -- user query\\\\n    '[...]'::extensions.vector(512), -- embedding generated from user query\\\\n    10\\\\n  );\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn practice, you will likely be calling this from the [Supabase client](/docs/reference/javascript/introduction) or through a custom backend layer. Here is a quick example of how you might call this from an [Edge Function](/docs/guides/functions) using JavaScript:\\\\n\\\\n```tsx\\\\nimport { createClient } from 'npm:@supabase/supabase-js@2'\\\\nimport OpenAI from 'npm:openai'\\\\n\\\\nconst supabaseUrl = Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!\\\\nconst supabaseServiceRoleKey = Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')!\\\\nconst openaiApiKey = Deno.env.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')!\\\\n\\\\nDeno.serve(async (req) => {\\\\n  // Grab the user's query from the JSON payload\\\\n  const { query } = await req.json()\\\\n\\\\n  // Instantiate OpenAI client\\\\n  const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: openaiApiKey })\\\\n\\\\n  // Generate a one-time embedding for the user's query\\\\n  const embeddingResponse = await openai.embeddings.create({\\\\n    model: 'text-embedding-3-large',\\\\n    input: query,\\\\n    dimensions: 512,\\\\n  })\\\\n\\\\n  const [{ embedding }] = embeddingResponse.data\\\\n\\\\n  // Instantiate the Supabase client\\\\n  // (replace service role key with user's JWT if using Supabase auth and RLS)\\\\n  const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceRoleKey)\\\\n\\\\n  // Call hybrid_search Postgres function via RPC\\\\n  const { data: documents } = await supabase.rpc('hybrid_search', {\\\\n    query_text: query,\\\\n    query_embedding: embedding,\\\\n    match_count: 10,\\\\n  })\\\\n\\\\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify(documents), {\\\\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\\\\n  })\\\\n})\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model to generate embeddings (shortened to 512 dimensions for faster retrieval). Swap in your preferred embedding model (and dimension size) accordingly.\\\\n\\\\nTo test this, make a `POST` request to the function's endpoint while passing in a JSON payload containing the user's query. Here is an example `POST` request using cURL:\\\\n\\\\n```tsx\\\\ncurl -i --location --request POST \\\\\\\\\\\\n  'http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/hybrid-search' \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <anonymous key>' \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --data '{\\\\\\\"query\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Italian recipes with tomato sauce\\\\\\\"}'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor more information on how to create, test, and deploy edge functions, see [Getting started](/docs/guides/functions/quickstart).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## See also\\\\n\\\\n*   [Embedding concepts](/docs/guides/ai/concepts)\\\\n*   [Vector columns](/docs/guides/ai/vector-columns)\\\\n*   [Vector indexes](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes)\\\\n*   [Semantic search](/docs/guides/ai/semantic-search)\\\\n*   [Full text (keyword) search](/docs/guides/database/full-text-search)\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Interpreting Supabase Grafana IO charts\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Interpreting Supabase Grafana IO charts\\\\n\\\\n> [Supabase Grafana Installation Guide](/docs/guides/platform/metrics#deploying-supabase-grafana)\\\\n\\\\nThere are two primary values that matter for IO:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Disk Throughput**: how much data can be moved to and from disk per second\\\\n*   **IOPS(Input/Output per second)**: how many read/write requests can be performed against your disk per second\\\\n\\\\nEach compute instance has unique IO settings.

This can be caused by\\\\n\\\\n*   **Excessive and needless sequential scans:** poorly indexed tables force requests to scan disk ([guide to resolve](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/22449))\\\\n*   **Too little cache**: There is not enough memory, so instead of reading data from the memory cache, it is accessed from disk ([guide to inspect](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/22449))\\\\n*   **Poorly optimized RLS policies**: RLS that rely heavily on joins are more likely to hit disk. If possible, they should optimized ([RLS best practice guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#rls-performance-recommendations))\\\\n*   **Excessive bloat**: This is the least likely to cause major issues, but bloat can take up space, preventing data on disk from being placed in the same locality. This can force the database to scan more pages than necessary. ([explainer guide](/blog/postgres-bloat))\\\\n*   **Uploading high amounts of data:** temporarily increase compute add-on size for the duration of the uploads\\\\n*   **Insufficient memory**: Sometimes an inadequate amount of memory forces queries to hit disk instead of the memory cache.

Partitioning can significantly improve query performance and simplify data management for large datasets.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Benefits of table partitioning\\\\n\\\\n*   **Improved query performance:** allows queries to target specific partitions, reducing the amount of data scanned and improving query execution time.\\\\n*   **Scalability:** With partitioning, you can add or remove partitions as your data grows or changes, enabling better scalability and flexibility.\\\\n*   **Efficient data management:** simplifies tasks such as data loading, archiving, and deletion by operating on smaller partitions instead of the entire table.\\\\n*   **Enhanced maintenance operations:** can optimize vacuuming and indexing, leading to faster maintenance tasks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Partitioning methods\\\\n\\\\nPostgres supports various partitioning methods based on how you want to partition your data. The commonly used methods are:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Range Partitioning**: Data is divided into partitions based on a specified range of values. For example, you can partition a sales table by date, where each partition represents a specific time range (e.g., one partition for each month).\\\\n2.  **List Partitioning**: Data is divided into partitions based on a specified list of values. For instance, you can partition a customer table by region, where each partition contains customers from a specific region (e.g., one partition for customers in the US, another for customers in Europe).\\\\n3.  **Hash Partitioning**: Data is distributed across partitions using a hash function. This method provides a way to evenly distribute data among partitions, which can be useful for load balancing. However, it doesn't allow direct querying based on specific values.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Creating partitioned tables\\\\n\\\\nLet's consider an example of range partitioning for a sales table based on the order date. We'll create monthly partitions to store data for each month:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table sales (\\\\n    id bigint generated by default as identity,\\\\n    order_date date not null,\\\\n    customer_id bigint,\\\\n    amount bigint,\\\\n\\\\n    -- We need to include all the\\\\n    -- partitioning columns in constraints:\\\\n    primary key (order_date, id)\\\\n)\\\\npartition by range (order_date);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table sales_2000_01\\\\n\\\\tpartition of sales\\\\n  for values from ('2000-01-01') to ('2000-02-01');\\\\n\\\\ncreate table sales_2000_02\\\\n\\\\tpartition of sales\\\\n\\\\tfor values from ('2000-02-01') to ('2000-03-01');\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nTo create a partitioned table you append `partition by range (<column_name>)` to the table creation statement. The column that you are partitioning with *must* be included in any unique index, which is the reason why we specify a composite primary key here (`primary key (order_date, id)`).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Querying partitioned tables\\\\n\\\\nTo query a partitioned table, you have two options:\\\\n\\\\n1.  Querying the parent table\\\\n2.  Querying specific partitions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Querying the parent table\\\\n\\\\nWhen you query the parent table, Postgres automatically routes the query to the relevant partitions based on the conditions specified in the query. This allows you to retrieve data from all partitions simultaneously.\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect *\\\\nfrom sales\\\\nwhere order_date >= '2000-01-01' and order_date < '2000-03-01';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query will retrieve data from both the `sales_2000_01` and `sales_2000_02` partitions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Querying specific partitions\\\\n\\\\nIf you only need to retrieve data from a specific partition, you can directly query that partition instead of the parent table. This approach is useful when you want to target a specific range or condition within a partition.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect *\\\\nfrom sales_2000_02;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis query will retrieve data only from the `sales_2000_02` partition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## When to partition your tables\\\\n\\\\nThere is no real threshold to determine when you should use partitions. Partitions introduce complexity, and complexity should be avoided until it's needed. A few guidelines:\\\\n\\\\n*   If you are considering performance, avoid partitions until you see performance degradation on non-partitioned tables.\\\\n*   If you are using partitions as a management tool, it's fine to create the partitions any time.\\\\n*   If you don't know how you should partition your data, then it's probably too early.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Examples\\\\n\\\\nHere are simple examples for each of the partitioning types in Postgres.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Range partitioning\\\\n\\\\nLet's consider a range partitioning example for a table that stores sales data based on the order date. We'll create monthly partitions to store data for each month.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, the **`sales`** table is partitioned into two partitions: **`sales_january`** and **`sales_february`**. The data in these partitions is based on the specified range of order dates:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table sales (\\\\n    id bigint generated by default as identity,\\\\n    order_date date not null,\\\\n    customer_id bigint,\\\\n    amount bigint,\\\\n\\\\n    -- We need to include all the\\\\n    -- partitioning columns in constraints:\\\\n    primary key (order_date, id)\\\\n)\\\\npartition by range (order_date);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table sales_2000_01\\\\n\\\\tpartition of sales\\\\n  for values from ('2000-01-01') to ('2000-02-01');\\\\n\\\\ncreate table sales_2000_02\\\\n\\\\tpartition of sales\\\\n\\\\tfor values from ('2000-02-01') to ('2000-03-01');\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### List partitioning\\\\n\\\\nLet's consider a list partitioning example for a table that stores customer data based on their region. We'll create partitions to store customers from different regions.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, the **`customers`** table is partitioned into two partitions: `customers_americas` and `customers_asia`. The data in these partitions is based on the specified list of regions:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- Create the partitioned table\\\\ncreate table customers (\\\\n    id bigint generated by default as identity,\\\\n    name text,\\\\n    country text,\\\\n\\\\n    -- We need to include all the\\\\n    -- partitioning columns in constraints:\\\\n    primary key (country, id)\\\\n)\\\\npartition by list(country);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table customers_americas\\\\n\\\\tpartition of customers\\\\n\\\\tfor values in ('US', 'CANADA');\\\\n\\\\ncreate table customers_asia\\\\n\\\\tpartition of customers\\\\n  for values in ('INDIA', 'CHINA', 'JAPAN');\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Hash partitioning\\\\n\\\\nYou can use hash partitioning to evenly distribute data.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, the **`products`** table is partitioned into two partitions: `products_one` and `products_two`. The data is distributed across these partitions using a hash function:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\ncreate table products (\\\\n    id bigint generated by default as identity,\\\\n    name text,\\\\n    category text,\\\\n    price bigint\\\\n)\\\\npartition by hash (id);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table products_one\\\\n\\\\tpartition of products\\\\n  for values with (modulus 2, remainder 1);\\\\n\\\\ncreate table products_two\\\\n\\\\tpartition of products\\\\n  for values with (modulus 2, remainder 0);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Other tools\\\\n\\\\nThere are several other tools available for Postgres partitioning, most notably [pg\\\\\\\\_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman). Native partitioning was introduced in Postgres 10 and is generally thought to have better performance.\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"How to Interpret and Explore the Postgres Logs\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# How to Interpret and Explore the Postgres Logs\\\\n\\\\n> A complimentary guide was made for the [API logs](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/22849)\\\\n\\\\n# Debugging and monitoring Postgres with logs\\\\n\\\\nLogs provide insights into Postgres operations.

This imposes three primary limitations:\\\\n\\\\n*   No subqueries or `WITH` statements\\\\n*   No `*` wildcards for column names\\\\n*   No `ILIKE` statements\\\\n\\\\nAlthough there are many strategies to filter logs, such as `like` and `in` statements, a helper function called [`regexp_contains`](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/22640) provides the most flexibility and control.\\\\n\\\\nThe `postgres_logs` table contains Postgres events.\\\\n\\\\n### `postgres_logs` table structure\\\\n\\\\nThe table contains 3 fundamental columns:\\\\n\\\\n| column          | description             |\\\\n| --------------- | ----------------------- |\\\\n| event\\\\\\\\_message  | the log's message       |\\\\n| timestamp       | time event was recorded |\\\\n| parsed metadata | metadata about event    |\\\\n\\\\nThe parsed metadata column is an array that contains relevant information about events. To access the information, it must be unnested.

To see the default types of events that are logged, you can check this [guide](https://gist.github.com/TheOtherBrian1/991d32c2b00dbc75d29b80d4cdf41aa7).\\\\n\\\\nWhen exploring the logs for atypical behavior, it's often strategic to filter out expected values. This can be done by adding the following filter to your queries:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n...query\\\\nwhere\\\\n  -- Excluding routine events related to cron, PgBouncer, checkpoints, and successful connections\\\\n  not regexp_contains(event_message, '^cron|PgBouncer|checkpoint|connection received|authenticated|authorized';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### By timeframe\\\\n\\\\nTo investigate issues around a specific period:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- filtering by time period\\\\n...query\\\\nwhere\\\\n  timestamp between '2024-05-06 04:44:00' and '2024-05-06 04:45:00'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### By error severity\\\\n\\\\nThis filter finds all errors, fatals, and panics:\\\\n\\\\n| Severity | Usage                                                        |\\\\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\\\\n| ERROR    | Reports an error that caused the current command to abort.   |\\\\n| FATAL    | Reports an error that caused the current session to abort.   |\\\\n| PANIC    | Reports an error that caused all database sessions to abort. |\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- find error events\\\\n... query\\\\nwhere\\\\n  parsed.error_severity in ('ERROR', 'FATAL', 'PANIC')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFailure events include an sql\\\\\\\\_state\\\\\\\\_code that can be referenced in the [Postgres Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html)\\\\n\\\\n### By query\\\\n\\\\n> NOTE: Unless pg\\\\\\\\_audit is configured, only failed queries are logged\\\\n\\\\n    -- find queries executed by the Dashboard\\\\n    ...query\\\\n    where\\\\n      regexp_contains(parsed.query, '(?i)select . <some table>')\\\\n\\\\nQueries can use complex syntax, so it is often helpful to isolate by referenced database objects, such as `functions`, `tables`, and `columns`.

This challenge amplifies when relying on certain poolers, such as Prisma Accelerate, Supavisor, or Cloudflare's Hyperdrive, as they record the pooler's IP, not the true origin.\\\\n\\\\nIP tracking is most effective when consistently relying on direct database connections from servers with static IP addresses:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- filter by IP\\\\nselect\\\\n  event_message,\\\\n  connection_from as ip,\\\\n  count(connection_from) as ip_count\\\\nfrom\\\\n  postgres_logs\\\\n  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata\\\\n  cross join unnest(parsed) as parsed\\\\nwhere\\\\n  regexp_contains(user_name, '<ROLE>')\\\\n  and regexp_contains(backend_type, 'client backend') -- only search for connections from outside the database (excludes cron jobs)\\\\n  and regexp_contains(event_message, '^connection authenticated') -- only view successful authentication events\\\\ngroup by connection_from, event_message\\\\norder by ip_count desc\\\\nlimit 100;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n# Reviewing log settings\\\\n\\\\nThe `pg_settings` table describes system and logging configurations.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- view system variables\\\\nselect * from pg_settings;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe settings that affect logs are categorized under:\\\\n\\\\n| Category                              | Description                                                                                                   |\\\\n| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| `Reporting and Logging / What to Log` | Specifies system events worth logging.                                                                        |\\\\n| `Reporting and Logging / When to Log` | Specifies certain conditions or rules for logging                                                             |\\\\n| `Customized Options`                  | Configures extensions and loaded modules, including those enhancing logging like auto\\\\\\\\_explain and pg\\\\\\\\_audit. |\\\\n\\\\nTo view all log settings for your database, you can execute the following SQL:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- view all log related settings\\\\nselect *\\\\nfrom pg_settings\\\\nwhere\\\\n  (\\\\n    category like 'Reporting and Logging / What to Log'\\\\n    or category like 'Reporting and Logging / When to Log'\\\\n    or category = 'Customized Options'\\\\n  )\\\\n  and name like '%log%';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Changing log settings\\\\n\\\\n> WARNING: lenient settings can lead to over-logging, impacting database performance while creating noise in the logs.\\\\n\\\\n#### Severity levels\\\\n\\\\nThe `log_min_messages` variable determines what is severe enough to log. Here are the severity thresholds from the [Postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html).\\\\n\\\\n| Severity         | Usage                                                                                                |\\\\n| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| DEBUG1 ..

To precisely navigate them, use the [Log Explorer](/dashboard/project/_/logs/explorer). These logs are managed through [Logflare](/blog/supabase-logs-self-hosted) and can be queried with a subset of BigQuery SQL syntax.\\\\n\\\\nThe log table that contains API requests is `edge_logs`.\\\\n\\\\nNotably, it contains:\\\\n\\\\n| field             | description                      |\\\\n| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |\\\\n| event\\\\\\\\_message    | the log's message                |\\\\n| timestamp         | time event was recorded          |\\\\n| request metadata  | metadata about the REST request  |\\\\n| response metadata | metadata about the REST response |\\\\n\\\\nThe request and response columns are arrays in the metadata field and must be unnested. This is done with a `cross join`.\\\\n\\\\n**Unnesting example**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nselect\\\\n  -- the event message does not require unnesting\\\\n  event_message,\\\\n  -- unnested status_code column from metadata.response field\\\\n  status_code\\\\nfrom\\\\n  edge_logs\\\\n  -- Unpack data stored in the 'metadata' field\\\\n  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata\\\\n  -- After unpacking the 'metadata' field, extract the 'response' field from it\\\\n  cross join unnest(response) as response;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe most useful fields for debugging are:\\\\n\\\\n> NOTE: not every field is included below.

Understanding the output of these commands can help you improve the performance of your applications by optimizing database interactions.\\\\n\\\\n### What is explain?\\\\n\\\\nThe Postgres EXPLAIN command shows the execution plan of a SQL query. This plan describes how the Postgres database will execute the query, including how tables will be scanned\\u2014by using sequential scans, index scans, etc.\\u2014and how rows will be joined.\\\\n\\\\n### How to use explain in Supabase\\\\n\\\\n**Using EXPLAIN through the SQL Editor**\\\\n\\\\n1.  Access your Supabase project\\\\n2.  Open the SQL editor\\\\n3.  Execute EXPLAIN with Your Query:\\\\n    `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1;`\\\\n\\\\n**Using EXPLAIN with supabase-js Library**\\\\n\\\\n1.  Follow the [Performance Debugging Guide](/docs/guides/database/debugging-performance) to enable the functionality on your project.\\\\n2.  Once debugging is enabled, you can use the [EXPLAIN](/docs/reference/javascript/explain?queryGroups=example\\\\\\\\&example=get-execution-plan-with-analyze-and-verbose) function in your application code. Here's how to use it\\\\n\\\\n<!---->\\\\n\\\\n    const { data, error } = await supabase\\\\n      .from('countries')\\\\n      .select()\\\\n      .explain({analyze:true,verbose:true})\\\\n\\\\n### Detailed breakdown of explain output components\\\\n\\\\n### 1. Plan type\\\\n\\\\n**- Seq Scan:** A sequential scan that reads all rows from a table. This is often seen in the absence of indexes that can be used for the query.\\\\n\\\\n**- Index Scan:** Uses an index to find rows quickly. This indicates that the query is able to use an index to efficiently locate data.\\\\n\\\\n**- Bitmap Heap Scan:** Uses a bitmap index to find rows quickly and then retrieves the actual rows from the table. This type of scan is efficient when retrieving a moderate number of rows.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Cost\\\\n\\\\n**cost=0.00..19.00:** This represents the estimated cost of executing the plan. The first number (0.00) is the cost of returning the first row, and the second number (19.00) is the total cost of executing the query and retrieving all rows. These values are arbitrary units determined by the database's cost model, not actual time or resources.\\\\n\\\\n**Start-up Cost:** The cost incurred before returning the first row.\\\\n**Total Cost:** The estimated total cost of the operation.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Rows\\\\n\\\\n**rows=1:** An estimate of the number of rows the query will return. Accurate row estimates depend on updated statistics; if the estimates are off, it might indicate that the database statistics need to be updated.\\\\n\\\\n### 4. Width\\\\n\\\\n**width=240:** The average number of bytes expected for the output rows. This indicates the expected data volume that needs to be processed or transferred, which can impact performance.\\\\n\\\\n### 5. Filters\\\\n\\\\n**Filter: (user\\\\\\\\_id = 1):** This shows any filters applied post-scan. Filters are conditions that are checked after retrieving the rows. A high number of rows being filtered out could indicate a need for better indexing.\\\\n\\\\n### 6. Execution time\\\\n\\\\n**Execution Time: 0.069 ms:** measures how long it took to actually execute the query, including retrieving the data, performing any sorts, joins, or other operations defined in the execution plan, and returning the final results. This time is measured in milliseconds.\\\\n\\\\n![image](/docs/img/troubleshooting/10950be3-264b-4a41-bc71-3d431c2756b2.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Detailed components in explain analyze\\\\n\\\\nWhen running EXPLAIN ANALYZE, additional information is provided, including:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Actual time:** Shows the time actually spent executing the scan and retrieving rows. This is split into the time to retrieve the first row (first) and the time to retrieve all rows (last).\\\\n\\\\n*   **Rows removed by filter:** Indicates how many rows were excluded due to not meeting the filter conditions.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Loops:** Shows how many times the node was executed, especially relevant in nested loop joins or subqueries.\\\\n\\\\nExample of Detailed EXPLAIN ANALYZE Output\\\\n\\\\n    Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..19.00 rows=1 width=240) (actual time=0.026..0.026 rows=1 loops=1)\\\\n      Filter: (user_id = 1)\\\\n      Rows Removed by Filter: 999\\\\n    Planning Time: 0.135 ms\\\\n\\\\n*   **actual time=0.026..0.026:** The time it took to start returning rows and to finish returning all rows.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Rows Removed by Filter:** 999: Indicates that many rows were checked against the filter, but most did not match the criteria.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Planning Time: 0.135 ms:** Planning Time refers to the amount of time the Postgres query planner takes to analyze the query and create an execution plan. This time is measured in milliseconds.\\\\n\\\\n### You might be asking yourself now, why there is two different sets of metrics : `(cost=0.42..2.64 rows=1 width=164) (actual time=0.020..0.021 rows=1 loops=1)`?\\\\n\\\\nTo answer you, one is for the estimated cost and performance, and another for the actual performance of the query as explained above.\\\\n\\\\n**Planning vs. Execution**: The estimates are based on the query planner's understanding of the data (gathered from statistics about table size, distribution of values, etc.), while the actual metrics tell you what really happened when the query ran. This comparison can highlight inaccuracies in the planner's assumptions.\\\\n\\\\n**Performance Tuning**: By comparing estimated rows and actual rows, or estimated time and actual time, you can identify potential performance issues. For example, if the estimated rows are significantly off from the actual rows, it might suggest that the table statistics are outdated, leading to inefficient query plans.\\\\n\\\\n**Identifying Bottlenecks**: If the actual time is significantly higher than expected, or if loops are more frequent than anticipated, these could be indicators of performance bottlenecks in the query.\\\\n\\\\n### How to read a complex explain output\\\\n\\\\nFirst, you have to understand that a Postgres execution plan is a tree structure consisting of several nodes. The top node (the Aggregate above) is at the top, and lower nodes are indented and start with an arrow (->). Nodes with the same indentation are on the same level (for example, the two relations combined with a join).\\\\n\\\\nHere's an example:\\\\n\\\\n    Aggregate Node (Top Node)\\\\n    \\u2502\\\\n    \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500> Sort Node\\\\n        \\u2502\\\\n        \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500> Hash Join Node\\\\n            \\u2502\\\\n            \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500> Seq Scan on users (Filtered)\\\\n            \\u2502\\\\n            \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500> Hash\\\\n                \\u2502\\\\n                \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500> Seq Scan on activities\\\\n\\\\nPostgres executes a plan top down, that is, it starts with producing the first result row for the top node. The executor processes lower nodes \\u201con demand\\u201d, that is, it fetches only as many result rows from them as it needs to calculate the next result of the upper node. This influences how you have to read \\u201ccost\\u201d and \\u201ctime\\u201d: the startup time for the upper node is at least as high as the startup time of the lower nodes, and the same holds for the total time. If you want to find the net time spent in a node, you have to subtract the time spent in the lower nodes. Parallel queries make that even more complicated.\\\\n\\\\nOn top of that, you have to multiply the cost and the time with the number of \\u201cloops\\u201d to get the total time spent in a node.\\\\n\\\\n### Common nodes in Postgres explain output\\\\n\\\\n| Node Type             | Description                                                                  |\\\\n| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| **Seq Scan**          | Scans each row of a table sequentially, often used without suitable indexes. |\\\\n| **Index Scan**        | Uses an index to quickly find rows, efficient for small fractions of rows.   |\\\\n| **Index Only Scan**   | Retrieves all needed data from the index itself, without visiting the table. |\\\\n| **Bitmap Heap Scan**  | Uses a bitmap of row locations to efficiently retrieve rows from the table.  |\\\\n| **Bitmap Index Scan** | Builds a bitmap by scanning the index to efficiently locate rows.            |\\\\n| **`Tid` Scan**        | Fetches rows directly using tuple identifiers, used in sub-selects.          |\\\\n| **Nested Loop**       | Joins two tables by scanning the first and then the second for each row.     |\\\\n| **Merge Join**        | Joins two pre-sorted tables, efficient for large datasets.                   |\\\\n| **Hash Join**         | Uses a hash table to perform joins, often faster for larger datasets.        |\\\\n| **Aggregate**         | Performs aggregation calculations like `SUM`, `COUNT`, etc.                  |\\\\n| **Sort**              | Sorts rows based on specified criteria, required for certain operations.     |\\\\n| **Limit**             | Returns a specified number of rows quickly, used with `LIMIT` clause.        |\\\\n| **CTE Scan**          | Scans a Common Table Expression, used for WITH clauses.                      |\\\\n| **Materialize**       | Materializes the result of a subquery or node to reuse without re-running.   |\\\\n| **Subquery Scan**     | Executes and provides the results of a subquery to the outer query.          |\\\\n| **Foreign Scan**      | Fetches data from foreign data sources outside the local database.           |\\\\n| **Function Scan**     | Retrieves results from a set-returning function.                             |\\\\n\\\\n### What to focus on in explain analyze output\\\\n\\\\n*   Find the nodes where most of the execution time was spent.\\\\n    `Hash Join  (cost=100.00..200.00 rows=1000 width=50) (actual time=50.012..150.023 rows=1000 loops=1)`\\\\n    Explanation:\\\\n    The actual time=50.012..150.023 indicates that this join operation took about 100 milliseconds to complete, making it a potential performance bottleneck.\\\\n*   Find the lowest node where the estimated row count is significantly different from the actual row count.\\\\n    `Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..50.00 rows=100 width=50) (actual time=0.010..25.000 rows=10000 loops=1)`\\\\n    Explanation:\\\\n    The estimated rows are 100, but the actual rows are 10,000. This discrepancy may lead the query planner to make inefficient choices, such as choosing a sequential scan over an index scan.\\\\n*   Find long-running sequential scans with a filter condition that removes many rows.\\\\n\\\\n<!---->\\\\n\\\\n    Seq Scan on products  (cost=0.00..100.00 rows=300 width=50) (actual time=50.000..100.000 rows=3 loops=1)\\\\n       Filter: (price > 1000)\\\\n       Rows Removed by Filter: 2997\\\\n\\\\nExplanation:\\\\nThis sequential scan took 50 to 100 milliseconds and filtered out 2997 of 3000 rows, indicating that only a few rows met the condition. This scenario is ideal for an index on the price column to optimize the performance by reducing the need for a full table scan.\\\\n\\\\n### Understanding the significance of milliseconds in Query Performance\\\\n\\\\nDetermining whether 100 milliseconds for e.g is noteworthy in the context of identifying performance bottlenecks depends on various factors:\\\\n\\\\n**Overall Query Execution Time:**\\\\n\\\\nIf the total execution time of a query significantly exceeds 100 milliseconds, then this particular step may not represent the main bottleneck. For instance, in queries that take several seconds to execute, a component that consumes just 100 milliseconds may not be the critical target for optimization efforts.\\\\n\\\\n**Complexity and Scale of the Query:**\\\\n\\\\nFor complex queries that involve multiple joins, subqueries, or aggregation functions, an operation that takes 100 milliseconds might actually reflect good efficiency. Conversely, for simpler queries or operations expected to be quick (such as fetching a few rows from a well-indexed table), 100 milliseconds could suggest a lack of efficiency.\\\\n\\\\nSo, the acceptable performance threshold can vary by application. For real-time systems or high-frequency trading platforms, even a few milliseconds can be critical, whereas for batch processing or data warehousing, longer execution times might be acceptable.\\\\n\\\\n### Tools to interpret explain analyze output\\\\n\\\\nSince reading a longer execution plan is quite cumbersome, you can use the website <https://explain.depesz.com/> to better visualize the query.

This depends on your [Secure Email Change](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers?provider=Email) setting.\\\\n\\\\n*   Secure Email Change enabled: two OTPs are generated, one for the current email (`user.email`) and one for the new email (`user.email_new`). You must send two emails.\\\\n*   Secure Email Change disabled: only one OTP is generated for the new email. You send a single email.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"caution\\\\\\\" title=\\\\\\\"Counterintuitive field naming\\\\\\\">\\\\n  The token hash field names are reversed due to backward compatibility. Pay careful attention to which token/hash pair goes with which email address:\\\\n\\\\n  *   `token_hash_new` \\u2192 use with the **current** email address (`user.email`) and `token`\\\\n  *   `token_hash` \\u2192 use with the **new** email address (`user.email_new`) and `token_new`\\\\n\\\\n  Do not assume the `_new` suffix refers to the new email address.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### What to send\\\\n\\\\nWhen Secure Email Change is enabled (both token/hash pairs present):\\\\n\\\\n*   Send to **current** email address (`user.email`): use `token` with `token_hash_new`\\\\n*   Send to **new** email address (`user.email_new`): use `token_new` with `token_hash`\\\\n\\\\nWhen Secure Email Change is **disabled** (only one token/hash pair present):\\\\n\\\\n*   Send a single email to the **new** email address. Use `token` with `token_hash` or `token_new` with `token_hash`, depending on which fields are present in the payload.\\\\n\\\\n<Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"http\\\\\\\" queryGroup=\\\\\\\"language\\\\\\\">\\\\n  <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"sql\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"SQL\\\\\\\">\\\\n    <Tabs scrollable size=\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\\"underlined\\\\\\\" defaultActiveId=\\\\\\\"sql-queue-email-messages\\\\\\\">\\\\n      <TabPanel id=\\\\\\\"sql-queue-email-messages\\\\\\\" label=\\\\\\\"Queue Email Messages\\\\\\\">\\\\n        Your company uses a worker to manage all emails related jobs.

This metric is essential for understanding how your application tracks and synchronizes shared state between users, such as online status, user activity, or custom state information.\\\\n\\\\nThe report displays the total number of presence events sent by clients, showing state synchronization activity throughout the selected time period. Presence events occur when clients `track`, `update`, or `untrack` their presence state in a channel, triggering `sync`, `join`, or `leave` events. Unlike broadcast messages, presence state is persisted in the channel so new joiners immediately receive the current state without waiting for other users to send updates.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Presence Events chart\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/presence-events-chart-dark.png',\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/presence-events-chart-light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Actions you can take\\\\n\\\\n| Action                    | Description                                                                                                                                                         | More information                                                                       |\\\\n| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Configure presence limits | Adjust the \\\\\\\"Max presence events per second\\\\\\\" setting to optimize presence state update throughput                                                                    | [Realtime Settings Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/settings)                              |\\\\n| Review quotas             | Understand presence messages per second limits (Free: 20, Pro: 50, Pro no spend cap/Team/Enterprise: 1,000) and presence keys per object limits (10 for most plans) | [Realtime Quotas Reference](/docs/guides/realtime/quotas)                              |\\\\n| Check logs                | Investigate presence errors or quota limit issues in your project dashboard                                                                                         | [Realtime Logs Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs)                 |\\\\n| Debug with logger         | Enable logging to track presence events and diagnose state synchronization issues                                                                                   | [Debugging Realtime with Logger](/docs/troubleshooting/realtime-debugging-with-logger) |\\\\n| Learn presence basics     | Understand how to implement and optimize presence state tracking in your application                                                                                | [Presence Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/presence)                                       |\\\\n| Contact support           | Request custom quota increases for Enterprise plans or discuss presence requirements                                                                                | [Support Portal](/dashboard/support/new)                                               |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Postgres Changes Events\\\\n\\\\nThe Postgres Changes Events report helps you monitor the volume of database change events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) sent to your Realtime clients over time. This metric is essential for understanding how your application processes database changes and identifying potential performance bottlenecks or scaling issues.\\\\n\\\\nThe report displays the total number of Postgres change events received by clients, showing database change activity throughout the selected time period. Postgres Changes use logical replication to stream database changes from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to subscribed clients. Each event represents a database change that has been broadcast to clients subscribed to the relevant schema and table. Note that Postgres Changes process changes on a single thread to maintain order, which can create bottlenecks at scale compared to Broadcast.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"Postgres Changes Events chart\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/postgres-changes-events-chart-dark.png',\\\\n    light: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/postgres-changes-events-chart-light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Actions you can take\\\\n\\\\n| Action                   | Description                                                                                           | More information                                                                         |\\\\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Review quotas            | Understand Postgres change payload size limits (1,024 KB for all plans) and message throughput limits | [Realtime Quotas Reference](/docs/guides/realtime/quotas)                                |\\\\n| Check logs               | Investigate Postgres Changes errors or performance issues in your project dashboard                   | [Realtime Logs Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs)                   |\\\\n| Learn Postgres Changes   | Understand limitations and best practices for using Postgres Changes                                  | [Postgres Changes Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes)                         |\\\\n| Migrate to Broadcast     | For better scalability, consider using Broadcast with database triggers instead of Postgres Changes   | [Broadcast Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast)                                       |\\\\n| Create database triggers | Understand how to create triggers that can send Broadcast messages on database events                 | [Database Triggers Guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/triggers)                       |\\\\n| Monitor replication      | Monitor logical replication health and lag since Postgres Changes reads from the WAL                  | [Replication Monitoring Guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-monitoring) |\\\\n| Contact support          | Discuss scaling strategies or custom solutions for high-volume database change subscriptions          | [Support Portal](/dashboard/support/new)                                                 |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Rate of Channel Joins\\\\n\\\\nThe Rate of Channel Joins report helps you monitor how quickly clients are joining Realtime channels over time.

When a user joins a private channel, Realtime checks RLS policies on the `realtime.messages` table to determine if the user has read access. This authorization check happens once per channel subscription and the result is cached for the duration of the connection. However, complex RLS policies with joins, function calls, or missing indexes can significantly increase this initial connection time.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"(Read) Private Channel Subscription RLS Execution Time chart\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/read-private-channel-subscription-rls-execution-time-chart-dark.png',\\\\n    light:\\\\n      '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/read-private-channel-subscription-rls-execution-time-chart-light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Actions you can take\\\\n\\\\n| Action                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | More information                                                                                  |\\\\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Configure connection pool  | Adjust the \\\\\\\"Database connection pool size\\\\\\\" setting to increase the number of connections available for RLS authorization checks, which can improve performance for high-volume channel subscriptions | [Realtime Settings Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/settings)                                         |\\\\n| Optimize RLS policies      | Learn how to optimize RLS policies with indexes, function wrapping, and query optimization techniques                                                                                                | [RLS Performance Best Practices](/docs/troubleshooting/rls-performance-and-best-practices-Z5Jjwv) |\\\\n| Check logs                 | Investigate RLS authorization errors or timeout issues in your project dashboard                                                                                                                     | [Realtime Logs Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs)                            |\\\\n| Learn authorization basics | Understand how RLS policies work with private channels and best practices for implementation                                                                                                         | [Realtime Authorization Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/authorization)                               |\\\\n| Create indexes             | Add indexes on columns frequently used in RLS policy conditions to speed up authorization checks                                                                                                     | [Database Indexes Guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes)                                  |\\\\n| Use index advisor          | Automatically detect missing indexes that could improve RLS policy performance                                                                                                                       | [Index Advisor Extension Guide](/docs/guides/database/extensions/index_advisor)                   |\\\\n| Optimize queries           | Learn techniques for optimizing queries including partial indexes and composite indexes for RLS conditions                                                                                           | [Query Optimization Guide](/docs/guides/database/query-optimization)                              |\\\\n| Monitor database           | Review database query performance and identify slow queries that may be affecting RLS execution                                                                                                      | [Database Observability Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/observability/database)                   |\\\\n| Contact support            | Discuss RLS optimization strategies or get assistance with complex authorization requirements                                                                                                        | [Support Portal](/dashboard/support/new)                                                          |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## (Write) Private Channel Subscription RLS Execution Time\\\\n\\\\nThe (Write)Private Channel Subscription RLS Execution Time report helps you monitor the median time it takes to execute Row Level Security (RLS) policies when users publish messages to private channels. This metric is essential for understanding how RLS policy complexity impacts message publishing latency and overall broadcast performance.\\\\n\\\\nThe report displays the median RLS execution time in milliseconds, showing how long it takes to validate user permissions when publishing to private channels throughout the selected time period. When a user sends a broadcast message to a private channel, Realtime checks RLS policies on the `realtime.messages` table to determine if the user has write (INSERT) access. This authorization check happens for the first message sent and then it's cached. Complex RLS policies with joins, function calls, or missing indexes can significantly increase first message publishing latency.\\\\n\\\\n<Image\\\\n  alt=\\\\\\\"(Write) Private Channel Subscription RLS Execution Time chart\\\\\\\"\\\\n  zoomable\\\\n  src={{\\\\n    dark: '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/write-private-channel-subscription-rls-execution-time-chart-dark.png',\\\\n    light:\\\\n      '/docs/img/guides/platform/realtime/reports/write-private-channel-subscription-rls-execution-time-chart-light.png',\\\\n  }}\\\\n/>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Actions you can take\\\\n\\\\n| Action                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | More information                                                                                  |\\\\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Configure connection pool  | Adjust the \\\\\\\"Database connection pool size\\\\\\\" setting to increase the number of connections available for RLS authorization checks, which can improve performance for high-frequency message publishing | [Realtime Settings Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/settings)                                         |\\\\n| Optimize RLS policies      | Learn how to optimize RLS policies with indexes, function wrapping, and query optimization techniques                                                                                                | [RLS Performance Best Practices](/docs/troubleshooting/rls-performance-and-best-practices-Z5Jjwv) |\\\\n| Check logs                 | Investigate RLS authorization errors or timeout issues when publishing messages in your project dashboard                                                                                            | [Realtime Logs Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs)                            |\\\\n| Learn authorization basics | Understand how RLS policies work with private channels for write operations and best practices for implementation                                                                                    | [Realtime Authorization Guide](/docs/guides/realtime/authorization)                               |\\\\n| Create indexes             | Add indexes on columns used in INSERT policies to speed up write authorization checks                                                                                                                | [Database Indexes Guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes)                                  |\\\\n| Use index advisor          | Automatically detect missing indexes that could improve write RLS policy performance                                                                                                                 | [Index Advisor Extension Guide](/docs/guides/database/extensions/index_advisor)                   |\\\\n| Optimize queries           | Learn techniques for optimizing INSERT policy queries including partial indexes for specific conditions                                                                                              | [Query Optimization Guide](/docs/guides/database/query-optimization)                              |\\\\n| Monitor database           | Review database query performance and identify slow queries that may be affecting write RLS execution                                                                                                | [Database Observability Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/observability/database)                   |\\\\n| Contact support            | Discuss RLS optimization strategies or get assistance with complex authorization requirements for high-frequency messaging                                                                           | [Support Portal](/dashboard/support/new)                                                          |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Total Requests\\\\n\\\\nThe Total Requests report helps you monitor the overall volume of HTTP requests for Realtime over time.

While this design choice brings [numerous benefits](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/1098894087.31930.62.camel@localhost.localdomain), it introduces a startup penalty for new connections. Moreover, connections are more memory-intensive and can strain Postgres's internal schedulers, limiting the sustainable number that can be formed. Resultingly, developers must be mindful of how they allocate the resource.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a client (backend server) connects to Postgres, the connection is stateful and enduring, allowing clients to greedily hold onto connections without any obligation to give them up. Typically, applications do not continuously send queries to a database, so this pattern underutilizes finite connections that could have serviced other clients.\\\\n\\\\nPostgres's shortcomings are particularly evident when handling transient servers, like edge functions. They not only hoard connections for brief queries but also aggressively open and close connections, straining the database.\\\\n\\\\n### How do poolers solve the problem?\\\\n\\\\nA pooler is ultimately a load balancer for database connections. It maintains several hot connections that it triages to clients. This reduces the startup cost of creating a new process on Postgres. The pooler can also more efficiently manage a database's finite connections by only allowing clients to access them when they need to execute a query (A.K.A. transaction mode).\\\\n\\\\n### Are poolers necessary?\\\\n\\\\nAll database connection libraries, such as Prisma, SQLAlchemy, and Postgres.js have built-in poolers. These are known as application-side poolers and they are fundamental for sustainable connection management. Most libraries have default pool sizes that may need to be changed for specific workloads. As an example, most edge/serverless functions are called to service a single user's request. They usually require significantly fewer connections (often 1 is optimal) than a dedicated application server.\\\\n\\\\nNote, that like databases, servers can only maintain a certain amount of connections themselves. If you were to increase the number aggressively, the server may not be able gracefully orchestrate them. For instance, Prisma's [default pool size](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/connection-pool#connection-pool-size) is automatically set to one more than twice the server's CPU count (1 + 2 \\\\\\\\* num\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_CPUs). The Prisma Team chose this value because it is generally performant with ORM's internal architecture.\\\\n\\\\nWhen deploying to static architecture, such as long-standing containers or VMs, application-side poolers are satisfactory on their own.\\\\n\\\\nWhen connecting to your application from serverless/edge functions, horizontally auto-scaling servers, or in cases where you need more connections than what the database can manage, it's best to complement application-side poolers with a serverside one. Supabase provides Supavisor as an option, but you could use alternatives, such as Prisma's Accelerate or Cloudflare's Hyperdrive.\\\\n\\\\nThey sit between the database and your client servers. They are solely optimized for sustaining high numbers of client connections and queuing and triaging queries to the database. Although they add network complexity, they are necessary when managing auto-scaling servers that can hypothetically form an infinite amount of connections.\\\\n\\\\n### Where are the connection strings\\\\n\\\\nSupabase provides 3 database connection strings that can be used simultaneously if necessary. You can find them on the dashboard by clicking [Connect](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true).\\\\n\\\\n#### Direct connections:\\\\n\\\\n> \\\\\\\"Note uses an IPv6 address by default. [Check here to see if your network is IPv6 compatible](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27034)\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n# Example connection string\\\\npostgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.ajrbwkcuthywfihaarmflo.supabase.co:5432/postgres\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Supavisor in transaction mode (port 6543)\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n# Example transaction string\\\\npostgresql://postgres.ajrbwkcuthywddfihrmflo:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Supavisor in session mode (port 5432)\\\\n\\\\n```sh\\\\n# Example session string\\\\npostgresql://postgres.ajrbwkcuthywfddihrmflo:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Supavisor: Transaction mode vs. Session mode?\\\\n\\\\nWhen a client forms a direct connection with Postgres, it usually will make a few queries, but may not utilize the connection the entire time. In transaction mode, a client is allowed to make a single query before being sent back to the figurative \\\\\\\"waiting room\\\\\\\". This prevents greedy or sedentary clients from hoarding connections. In most cases, this increases query throughput and is optimal.\\\\n\\\\nIn session mode, once the pooler assigns a direct connection, it stays with that client until voluntarily surrendered.\\\\n\\\\nThis behavior mirrors a direct connection, allowing greedy clients to monopolize the pool. This raises a question: what is the purpose of session mode?\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your application's configurations, having the pooler manage a queue of patient clients is preferable to the alternative of constantly polling the database to check for an available connection. Session mode can queue clients for up to a minute. If this isn't particularly relevant to your application design, then the primary benefit is that it is [IPv4 compatible](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27034). Also, unlike transaction mode, it supports prepared statements.\\\\n\\\\n### What happens when a client library, such as Prisma, connects through Supavisor?\\\\n\\\\nWhen clients connect to either Postgres or Supavisor, they do so with the Postgres Wire Protocol. Because of this, clients treat connections with pooler as if they were directly connected to Postgres. The pooler then smoothly acts as a messenger between the database and the client.\\\\n\\\\n### What are \\\\\\\"client connections\\\\\\\"?\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, they have nothing to do with front-end clients. They are the amount of backend-server connections that can connect to a serverside pooler.\\\\nImagine a chess tournament with 60 boards. Each board represents a connection in a database. When a player sits down at a board, it's like a client connecting to the database. They can take their time with their moves or just sit there, not making any.\\\\n\\\\nBut when the tournament fills up and all the boards are taken, new players are turned away, and told to check back at a later time to see if a table becomes available.\\\\n\\\\nNow, imagine the tournament organizers decide to expand the venue to house 200 people without adding more tables. Even when all boards are occupied, players don't have to leave. They can wait in the wings, and the moment a board opens up, someone from the waiting area can take their place. Likewise, if someone ends their game, but wants to play again, they can just go back to the waiting area. The waiting area represents the \\\\\\\"Max Client Connections\\\\\\\". Ultimately, the additional capacity provided by the pooler ensures fewer people are turned away from the \\\\\\\"tournament\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n### In the context of Supavisor, what does \\\\\\\"pool size\\\\\\\" mean?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Pool size\\\\\\\" refers to the maximum number of direct connections the pooler can maintain per unique user, database, and mode combination. You can adjust it in the [project connect page](/dashboard/project/_/database/settings) to strike a balance between efficient resource utilization and accommodating peak traffic.\\\\n\\\\n### What is the \\\\\\\"user+db+mode\\\\\\\" combination?\\\\n\\\\nPostgres is not actually a database. It is a Relational Database Management System (RDMS). Within it, you can spawn Postgres databases. In Supabase, it is a common pattern to just use the default database called `postgres`, but you could create more:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nCREATE DATABASE postgres;\\\\nCREATE DATABASE another_database;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a database can have many database users, but most people just rely on the default user `postgres`.\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nCREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'super-secret-password;\\\\nCREATE USER some_new_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe modes are transaction (port 6543) and session (port 5432) mode.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"user+database+mode\\\\\\\" combinations are formed from the above variables and are used within the connection string:\\\\n\\\\n    postgres://[USER].shfmmplnqscentnakbkl:[password]@aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:[MODE]/[DATABASE]\\\\n\\\\nWhen a distinct combination connects to your database, a new direct connection pool will be created. That means if you have two combinations connecting and the \\\\\\\"Pool Size\\\\\\\" is set to 120, each combination will have permission to form 120 connections. This can become problematic if collectively they exhaust all available direct connections.\\\\n\\\\n### **Does Supavisor immediately establish the max pool size?**\\\\n\\\\nNo, it doesn't. Let's break it down:\\\\n\\\\n*   In transaction mode, the pooler will only add connections if there are not enough connections to service all pending queries simultaneously. If 10 clients connect, but a single direct connection can comfortably accommodate them all, the pooler will not create more.\\\\n*   If necessary, it can create as many connections to prevent queries from pending up to the limit specified by the \\\\\\\"Pool Size\\\\\\\".\\\\n*   In session mode, it will immediately create a new a direct connection for a new client unless the \\\\\\\"Pool Size\\\\\\\" is reached\\\\n*   In transaction mode, once a direct connection is established, the pooler will keep it available for reuse for another client. However, if the connection remains unused for 5 minutes, the pooler will close it to free up database resources. In session mode, the connection will be immediately closed.\\\\n*   If a client is connected to the pooler, then at least 1 hot connection will be sustained, even if no client needs it.\\\\n\\\\n### **How to change pool size**\\\\n\\\\nIn the [Dashboard's Database Settings](/dashboard/project/_/database/settings), you can configure Supavisor's \\\\\\\"Pool Size\\\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\nYou can also change the pool size for PostgREST's (DB API) internal pooler at the bottom of the [application settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).\\\\n\\\\n### Do all services on Supabase use Supavisor?\\\\n\\\\nSupabase Storage uses Supavisor internally. The other servers that communicate with Postgres (PostgREST, Realtime, and Auth) all rely on internal application poolers.\\\\n\\\\nSupavisor is primarily intended for users who do not want to rely on the Supabase Client libraries and instead prefer to work with external ORMs, such as Prisma, Drizzle, and Psycopg.\\\\n\\\\n### **Whether to change Supavisor's pool size?**\\\\n\\\\nIn an ideal scenario, Postgres would support an unlimited number of direct connections, but there's a limit to how many it can handle. If Supavisor uses most of the available connections, you risk depriving other servers, such as Auth, from accessing your database. Still, as much as possible, you want to give your pooler freedom to grow its pool as needed to service demand.\\\\n\\\\nIt's important to note that the Storage server also uses Supavisor as a unique \\\\\\\"user+db+mode\\\\\\\" combination, so the pool size you set for your general application will apply to it, too.\\\\n\\\\nAs a rule of thumb, if you're using the DB REST API or multiple app-based \\\\\\\"user+db+mode\\\\\\\" combinations, try to keep the pooler's usage under 40% of available connections. Otherwise, you can cautiously increase usage to around 80%. These percentages are flexible and depend on your application's usage and setup. Monitor connection usage to determine the optimal allocation without depriving other servers of necessary connections.\\\\n\\\\n### **How to monitor connections**\\\\n\\\\n> EDIT: a more in-depth [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27141) for connection monitoring was published\\\\n\\\\nConnection usage can be monitored with a Supabase Grafana Dashboard. It provides realtime visibility of over 200 database metrics, such as graphs of CPU, EBS, and active direct/pooler connections. It can be extremely useful for monitoring and debugging instances.\\\\n\\\\nYou can check our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-grafana) for setup instructions for local deployments or free cloud deployments on [Fly.io](http://fly.io/). Refer to Supabase [documentation](/docs/guides/platform/metrics) to learn more about the metrics endpoint.\\\\n\\\\n### **Can Supavisor really support a million connections?**\\\\n\\\\nIt depends.\\\\n\\\\nIn the article [\\\\\\\"Supavisor: Scaling Postgres to 1 Million Connections\\\\\\\"](/blog/supavisor-1-million) we gave Supavisor the capacity to connect to a million clients simultaneously. The pooler triaged the clients' queries to 400 database connections.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is important is that the database processing these queries had 64vCPUs and 256GB of memory. It could process the queries fast enough to ensure that there was never a noticeable bottleneck. The clients never waited long enough to timeout. If the clients were asking to run inefficient queries, like the one below, a severe backlog of pending client queries would have formed:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\n-- do nothing for 60 seconds\\\\nselect pg_sleep(60);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nA backlog could also happen if there are not enough direct connections available. In our setup, 400 connections were enough to handle a million clients, ensuring a smooth flow of requests. But if we had only 1 direct connection, the queue would've moved too slowly and clients would expire their requests.\\\\n\\\\nScaling to this level only works when the pooler is operating in transaction mode. In Session mode, hypothetically, the 400 clients that first accessed the direct connections could keep them, even if they are no longer executing queries. The pending 999,600 clients waiting for a turn would then be starved of direct connections.\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Database Replication\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Database Replication\\\\n\\\\nAn introduction to database replication and change data capture.\\\\n\\\\nReplication is the process of copying changes from your database to another location.

As you make changes, they are appended to the WAL, which is a series of files (also called \\\\\\\"segments\\\\\\\") where the file size can be specified. Once one segment is full, Postgres will start appending to a new segment. After a period of time, a checkpoint occurs and Postgres synchronizes the WAL with your database. Once the checkpoint is complete, then the WAL files can be removed from disk and free up space.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Logical replication and WAL\\\\n\\\\nLogical replication is a method of replication where Postgres uses the WAL files and transmit those changes to another Postgres database, or a system that supports reading WAL files.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### LSN\\\\n\\\\nLSN is a Log Sequence Number that is used to identify the position of a WAL file in the WAL directory. It is often used to determine the progress of replication in subscribers and calculate the lag of a replication slot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Logical replication architecture\\\\n\\\\nWhen setting up logical replication, three key components are involved:\\\\n\\\\n*   `publication` - A set of tables on your primary database that will be `published`\\\\n*   `replication slot` - A slot used for replicating the data from a single publication. The slot, when created, will specify the output format of the changes\\\\n*   `subscription` - A subscription is created from an external system (i.e. another Postgres database) and must specify the name of the `publication`. If you do not specify a replication slot, one is automatically created\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Logical replication output format\\\\n\\\\nLogical replication is typically output in 2 forms, `pgoutput` and `wal2json`. The output method is how Postgres sends changes to any active replication slot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Logical replication configuration\\\\n\\\\nWhen using logical replication, Postgres is then configured to keep WAL files around for longer than it needs them. If the files are removed too quickly, then your `replication slot` will become inactive and, if the database receives a large number of changes in a short time, then the `replication slot` can become lost as it was not able to keep up.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to mitigate this, Postgres has many options and settings that can be [tweaked](/docs/guides/database/custom-postgres-config) to manage the WAL usage effectively. Not all of these settings are user configurable as they can impact the stability of your database. For those that are, these should be considered as advanced configuration and not changed without understanding that they can cause additional disk space and resources to be used, as well as incur additional costs.\\\\n\\\\n| Setting                                                                                  | Description                                            | User-facing | Default |\\\\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------- |\\\\n| [`max_replication_slots`](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/max_replication_slots/)   | Max count of replication slots allowed                 | No          |         |\\\\n| [`wal_keep_size`](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/wal_keep_size/)                   | Minimum size of WAL files to keep for replication      | No          |         |\\\\n| [`max_slot_wal_keep_size`](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/max_slot_wal_keep_size/) | Max WAL size that can be reserved by replication slots | No          |         |\\\\n| [`checkpoint_timeout`](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/checkpoint_timeout/)         | Max time between WAL checkpoints                       | No          |         |\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"Understanding API keys\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Understanding API keys\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSupabase gives you fine-grained control over which application components are allowed to access your project through API keys.\\\\n\\\\nAPI keys provide the first layer of authentication for data access.

The API key *does not* distinguish between users, only between applications.\\\\n\\\\nThere are 4 types of API keys that can be used with Supabase:\\\\n\\\\n| Type                                                       | Format                                                           | Privileges | Availability                                              | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\\\\n| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| Publishable\\u00a0key                                            | <span className=\\\\\\\"!whitespace-nowrap\\\\\\\">`sb_publishable_...`</span> | Low        | Platform                                                  | Safe to expose online: web page, mobile or desktop app, GitHub actions, CLIs, source code.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\\\\n| Secret\\u00a0keys                                                | <span className=\\\\\\\"!whitespace-nowrap\\\\\\\">`sb_secret_...`</span>      | Elevated   | Platform                                                  | **Only use in backend components of your app:** servers, already secured APIs (admin panels), [Edge Functions](/docs/guides/functions), microservices, etc. They provide *full access* to your project's data, bypassing [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security). |\\\\n| <span className=\\\\\\\"!whitespace-nowrap\\\\\\\">`anon`</span>         | JWT (long lived)                                                 | Low        | <span className=\\\\\\\"!whitespace-nowrap\\\\\\\">Platform, CLI</span> | Exactly like the publishable key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\\\\n| <span className=\\\\\\\"!whitespace-nowrap\\\\\\\">`service_role`</span> | JWT (long lived)                                                 | Elevated   | <span className=\\\\\\\"!whitespace-nowrap\\\\\\\">Platform, CLI</span> | Exactly like secret keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\">\\\\n  `anon` and `service_role` keys are based on the project's JWT secret. They are generated when your project is created and can only be changed when you rotate the JWT secret. This can cause significant issues in production applications. Use the publishable and secret keys instead.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"note\\\\\\\" title=\\\\\\\"Changes to API keys\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Supabase is changing the way keys work to improve project security and developer experience. You can [read the full announcement](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260), but in the transition period, you can use both the current `anon` and `service_role` keys and the new publishable key with the form `sb_publishable_xxx` which will replace the older keys.\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Where to find keys\\\\n\\\\nYou can find API keys in a couple of different places.\\\\n\\\\nIn most cases, you can get the correct key from [the Project's **Connect** dialog](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true), but if you want a specific key, you can find all keys in [the API Keys section of a Project's Settings page](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys/):\\\\n\\\\n*   **For legacy keys**, copy the `anon` key for client-side operations and the `service_role` key for server-side operations from the **Legacy API Keys** tab.\\\\n*   **For new keys**, open the **API Keys** tab, if you don't have a publishable key already, click **Create new API Keys**, and copy the value from the **Publishable key** section.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## `anon` and publishable keys\\\\n\\\\nThe `anon` and publishable keys secure the public components of your application. Public components run in environments where it is impossible to secure any secrets. These include:\\\\n\\\\n*   Web pages, where the key is bundled in source code.\\\\n*   Mobile or desktop applications, where the key is bundled inside the compiled packages or executables.\\\\n*   CLI, scripts, tools, or other pre-built executables.\\\\n*   Other publicly available APIs that return the key without prior additional authorization.\\\\n\\\\nThese environments are always considered public because anyone can retrieve the key from the source code or build artifacts. Obfuscation can increase the difficulty, but never eliminate the possibility. (In general, obfuscation, Turing test challenges, and specialized knowledge do not count as authorization for the purpose of securing secrets.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Interaction with Supabase Auth\\\\n\\\\nUsing the `anon` or publishable key does not mean that your user is anonymous. (Thinking of both these keys as publishable rather than `anon` makes the mental model clearer.)\\\\n\\\\nYour application can be authenticated with the publishable key, while your user is authenticated (via Supabase Auth) with their personal JWT:\\\\n\\\\n| Key             | User logged in via Supabase Auth | Postgres role used for RLS, etc. |\\\\n| --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\\\\n| Publishable key | No                               | `anon`                           |\\\\n| `anon`          | No                               | `anon`                           |\\\\n| Publishable key | Yes                              | `authenticated`                  |\\\\n| `anon`          | Yes                              | `authenticated`                  |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Protection\\\\n\\\\nThese keys provide first-layer protection to your project's data, performance and bill, such as:\\\\n\\\\n*   Providing basic Denial-of-Service protection, by requiring a minimal threshold of knowledge.\\\\n*   Protecting your bill by ignoring bots, scrapers, automated vulnerability scanners and other well meaning or random Internet activity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Security considerations\\\\n\\\\nThe publishable and `anon` keys are not intended to protect from the following, since key retrieval is always possible from a public component:\\\\n\\\\n*   Static or dynamic code analysis and reverse engineering attempts.\\\\n*   Use of the Network inspector in the browser.\\\\n*   Cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting, phishing attacks.\\\\n*   Man-in-the-middle attacks.\\\\n\\\\nWhen using the publishable or `anon` key, access to your project's data is guarded by Postgres via the built-in `anon` and `authenticated` roles. For full protection make sure:\\\\n\\\\n*   You have enabled Row Level Security on all tables.\\\\n*   You regularly review your Row Level Security policies for permissions granted to the `anon` and `authenticated` roles.\\\\n*   You do not modify the role's attributes without understanding the changes you are making.\\\\n\\\\nYour project's [Security Advisor](/dashboard/project/_/advisors/security) constantly checks for common security problems with the built-in Postgres roles. Make sure you carefully review each finding before dismissing it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## `service_role` and secret keys\\\\n\\\\nUnlike the `anon` and publishable key, the `service_role` and secret keys allow elevated access to your project's data. It is meant to be used only in secure, developer-controlled components of your application, such as:\\\\n\\\\n*   Servers that implement prior authorization themselves, such as Edge Functions, microservices, traditional or specialized web servers.\\\\n*   Periodic jobs, queue processors, topic subscribers.\\\\n*   Admin and back-office tools, with prior authorization checks only.\\\\n*   Data processing pipelines, such as for analytics, reports, backups, or database synchronization.\\\\n\\\\n<Admonition type=\\\\\\\"caution\\\\\\\">\\\\n  Never expose your `service_role` and secret keys publicly. Your data is at risk. **Do not:**\\\\n\\\\n  *   Add in web pages, public documents, source code, bundle in executables or packages for mobile, desktop or CLI apps.\\\\n  *   Send over chat applications, email or SMS to your peers.\\\\n  *   Never use in a browser, even on `localhost`!\\\\n  *   Do not pass in URLs or query params, as these are often logged.\\\\n  *   Be careful passing them in request headers without prior log sanitization.\\\\n  *   Take extra care logging even potentially **invalid API keys**. Simple typos might reveal the real key in the future.\\\\n  *   Reveal, copy, use or manipulate on hardware devices without full disk encryption and which you do not directly own or control (such as public computers, friend's laptop, etc.)\\\\n\\\\n  Ensure you handle them with care and using [secure coding practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/stable-en/).\\\\n</Admonition>\\\\n\\\\nSecret keys and the `service_role` JWT-based API key authorize access to your project's data via the built-in `service_role` Postgres role. By design, this role has full access to your project's data. It also uses the [`BYPASSRLS` attribute](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html#:~:text=BYPASSRLS), skipping any and all Row Level Security policies you attach.\\\\n\\\\nThe secret key is an improvement over the old JWT-based `service_role` key, and we recommend using it where possible. It adds more checks to prevent misuse, specifically:\\\\n\\\\n*   You cannot use a secret key in the browser (matches on the `User-Agent` header) and it will always reply with HTTP 401 Unauthorized.\\\\n*   You don't need to have any secret keys if you are not using them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Best practices for handling secret keys\\\\n\\\\nBelow are some starting guidelines on how to securely work with secret keys:\\\\n\\\\n*   Always work with secret keys on computers you fully own or control.\\\\n*   Use secure & encrypted send tools to share API keys with others (often provided by good password managers), but prefer the [API Keys](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys) dashboard instead.\\\\n*   Prefer encrypting them when stored in files or environment variables.\\\\n*   Do not add in source control, especially for CI scripts and tools. Prefer using the tool's native secrets capability instead.\\\\n*   Prefer using a separate secret key for each separate backend component of your application, so that if one is found to be vulnerable or to have leaked the key you will only need to change it and not all.\\\\n*   Even though a secret key will always return HTTP 401 Unauthorized error when used in a browser, it does not mean that attackers will not use it with other tools. Delete immediately!\\\\n*   If you must include them in logs, log the first few random characters (but never more than 6).\\\\n*   If you wish to log or store which valid API key was used, store it as a SHA256 hash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### What to do if a secret key or `service_role` has been leaked or compromised?\\\\n\\\\nDon't rush if this has happened, or you are suspecting it has. Make sure you have fully considered the situation and have remediated the root cause of the suspicion or vulnerability **first**. Consider using the [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) as an easy way to identify the severity of the incident and to plan your next steps.\\\\n\\\\nRotating a secret key (`sb_secret_...`) is easy and painless. Use the [API Keys](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys) dashboard to create a new secret API key, then replace it with the compromised key. Once all components are using the new key, delete the compromised one.\\\\n\\\\n**Deleting a secret key is irreversible and once done it will be gone forever.**\\\\n\\\\nIf you are still using the JWT-based `service_role` key, there are two options.\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Strongly recommended:** Replace the `service_role` key with a new secret key instead. Follow the guide from above as if you are rotating an existing secret key.\\\\n2.  [Rotate your project's JWT secret.](/dashboard/project/_/settings/jwt) This operation is only recommended if you suspect that the JWT secret has leaked itself. Consider switching your `anon` JWT-based key to the publishable key, and all `service_role` JWT-based keys to secret keys. Only then rotate the JWT secret. Check the FAQ below if you use the JWT-based keys in mobile, desktop or CLI applications!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Known limitations and compatibility differences\\\\n\\\\nAs the publishable and secret keys are no longer JWT-based, there are some known limitations and compatibility differences that you may need to plan for:\\\\n\\\\n*   You cannot send a publishable or secret key in the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header, except if the value exactly equals the `apikey` header. In this case, your request will be forwarded down to your project's database, but will be rejected as the value is not a JWT.\\\\n*   Edge Functions **only support JWT verification** via the `anon` and `service_role` JWT-based API keys. You will need to use the `--no-verify-jwt` option when using publishable and secret keys. The Supabase platform does not verify the `apikey` header when using Edge Functions in this way. Implement your own `apikey`-header authorization logic inside the Edge Function code itself.\\\\n*   Public Realtime connections are limited to 24 hours in duration, unless the connection is upgraded and further maintained with user-level authentication via Supabase Auth or a supported Third-Party Auth provider.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Frequently asked questions\\\\n\\\\n{/* supa-mdx-lint-disable Rule004ExcludeWords */}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### I am using JWT-based `anon` key in a mobile, desktop, or CLI application and need to rotate my `service_role` JWT secret?\\\\n\\\\nIf you know or suspect that the JWT secret itself is leaked, refer to the section on [rotating the JWT](#what-to-do-if-a-secret-key-or-servicerole-has-been-leaked-or-compromised).\\\\n\\\\nIf the JWT secret is secure, prefer substituting the `service_role` JWT-based key with a new secret key which you can create in the [API Keys](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys) dashboard. This will prevent downtime for your application.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Can I still use my old `anon` and `service-role` API keys after enabling the publishable and secret keys?\\\\n\\\\nYes. This allows you to transition between the API keys with zero downtime by gradually swapping your clients while both sets of keys are active. See the next question for how to deactivate your keys once all your clients are switched over.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### How do I deactivate the `anon` and `service_role` JWT-based API keys after moving to publishable and secret keys?\\\\n\\\\nYou can do this in the [API Keys](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys) dashboard. To prevent downtime in your application's components, use the last used indicators on the page to confirm that these are no longer used before deactivating.\\\\n\\\\nYou can re-activate them should you need to.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Why are `anon` and `service_role` JWT-based keys no longer recommended?\\\\n\\\\nSince the start of Supabase, the JWT-based `anon` and `service_role` keys were the right trade-off against simplicity and relative security for your project. Unfortunately they pose some real challenges in live applications, especially around rotation and security best practices.\\\\n\\\\nThe main reasons for preferring the publishable and secret keys (`sb_publishable_...` and `sb_secret_...`) are:\\\\n\\\\n*   Tight coupling between the JWT secret (which itself can be compromised, if you mint your own JWTs), the `anon` (low privilege) and `service_role` (high privilege) and `authenticated` (issued by Supabase Auth) Postgres roles.\\\\n*   Inability to independently rotate each aspect of the keys, without downtime.\\\\n*   Inability to roll-back an unnecessary or problematic JWT secret rotation.\\\\n*   Publishing new versions of mobile applications can take days and often weeks in the app review phase with Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. A forced rotation can cause weeks of downtime for mobile app users.\\\\n*   Users may continue using desktop, CLI and mobile apps with very old versions, making rotation impossible without a forced version upgrade.\\\\n*   JWTs had 10-year expiry duration, giving malicious actors more to work with.\\\\n*   JWTs were self-referential and full of redundant information not necessary for achieving their primary purpose.\\\\n*   JWTs are large, hard to parse, verify, and manipulate -- leading to insecure logging or bad security practices.\\\\n*   They were signed with a symmetric JWT secret.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Why is there no publishable or secret keys in the CLI / self-hosting?\\\\n\\\\nPublishable and secret keys are only available on the Supabase hosted platform. They are managed by our API Gateway component, which does not currently have a CLI equivalent.\\\\n\\\\nWe are looking into providing similar but limited in scope support for publishable or secret keys in the future. For now you can only use the `anon` and `service_role` JWT-based keys there.\\\\n\\\\nFor advanced users, see the following question on how these keys are implemented on the hosted platform for an idea on how to provide similar functionality for yourself.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### How are publishable and secret keys implemented on the hosted platform?\\\\n\\\\nWhen your applications use the Supabase APIs they go through a component called the API Gateway on the Supabase hosted platform. This provides us (and therefore you) with the following features:\\\\n\\\\n*   Observability and logging.\\\\n*   Performance and request routing (such as to read-replicas).\\\\n*   Security, for blocking malicious patterns or behavior on a global scale.\\\\n\\\\nThis API Gateway component is able to verify the API key (sent in the `apikey` request header, or for WebSocket in a query param) against your project's publishable and secret key list. If the match is found, it mints a temporary, short-lived JWT that is then forwarded down to your project's servers.\\\\n\\\\nIt may be possible to replicate similar behavior if you self-host by using programmable proxies such as [Kong](https://konghq.com/), [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) or similar.\\\\n\\\"}]}}\", \"annotations\": null, \"meta\": null}], \"structuredContent\": null, \"isError\": false}",

No.\nI'll add debug info in `Home.jsx` again, printing `JSON.stringify(posts[0])`.\nDisplay it in the red box.\nThen rebuild.\nThis is tedious but necessary to fix the UI not showing names.\nAlso, I should remove the error simulation I added previously (no I didn't add simulation, I just simplified query, then reverted).\n\nWait, I saw \"Posts Count: 4\" in the red debug box in the PREVIOUS screenshot (screenshot_20260226_050658_332251.png).\nWait, did I?\nThe accessibility tree for `screenshot_20260226_050658_332251.png` shows:\n```\n[51] generic\n    StaticText 'Debug: API:'\n    InlineTextBox 'Debug: API:'\n    StaticText 'http://10.0.0.17:64966'\n    InlineTextBox 'http://10.0.0.17:64966'\n    ...\n    StaticText 'Posts Count:'\n    InlineTextBox 'Posts Count:'\n    StaticText '4'\n    InlineTextBox '4'\n```\nSo posts ARE fetched.\nAnd further down in AXTree:\n```\n[64] generic\n    [65] generic, clickable\n        [66] generic\n            [67] link 'U', clickable, url='...'\n                [68] generic\n                    [69] generic\n                        StaticText 'U'\n```\nThe text 'Alice Wonderland' is NOT there.\nWait, look at line 83 in AXTree:\n`[83] paragraph '' StaticText 'Hello from Alice!'`\nBut where is the user name?\nIt should be in the link [67] or near it.\nIt seems `post.profiles` is failing to provide data or is in wrong format.\n\nIf `post.profiles` is an array: `[ { username: 'alice', ... } ]`.\nThen `post.profiles.full_name` is undefined.\nI suspect it IS an array.\nWhy? Maybe `user_id` in `posts` is just a column with an FK, but Supabase might treat it as \"referencing profiles\", and since there could be multiple posts per user, it knows `users -> posts` is One-to-Many.\nBut here we are querying `posts` and joining `profiles`.\nEach post has ONE profile.\nSo it SHOULD be object.\n\nHowever, sometimes if the relation is not explicitly defined as One-to-One (it is not, it is Many-to-One), Supabase might return array if the internal logic thinks \"it's a join\".\nNo, `select('*, profiles(*)')` returns object for Many-to-One.\nVerification: I'll use `Array.isArray(post.profiles)` in the debug print.\nOr just print the first post object.\n\nLet's modify `Home.jsx` to debug `posts[0]`.\n"

No, `text-foreground`.\nMaybe `full_name` is null? I seeded it.\nMaybe `post.user_id` does not match any profile?\nI seeded posts with `alice.id` and `bob.id`. `alice` and `bob` were created via `auth.admin.createUser`.\nThen I upserted profiles with SAME ids.\nSo they should match.\n\nMaybe I should just try to seed again? No, seed runs once.\nI can check if there are orphan posts.\n`select count(*) from posts left join profiles on posts.user_id = profiles.id where profiles.id is null;`\n\nIf count > 0, then we have orphan posts.\nI'll run SQL to check.\n"
