Your task is to build the application.\nIt is crucial your code works and follows the specification and deployment instructions given below. Focus hard when writing the code.\nYou CANNOT interact with the user at any point, you are on your own. Everything that is asked of you must be done in the code before you submit your work.\nYou CANNOT expect the user to perform any actions during or after the code is written.\nDO NOT stop working until you have a fully working application that you have tested.\nIT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU MAKE SURE TO TEST THE APPLICATION BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR WORK, INCLUDING MAKING SURE YOU BUILD AND START THE DOCKER COMPOSE APPLICATION. DO NOT SUBMIT APPLICATIONS THAT DO NOT RUN. ALWAYS ASSUME ANY ERRORS IN BUILDING OR TESTING THE APPLICATION ARE YOUR FAULT AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX.\n\n<TECH_STACK_GUIDELINES>\nTech stack guidelines:\nAlways use **React with Vite** as the framework for the frontend.\nDo not use Next.js or any other framework unless explicitly requested.\n\nProject scaffold guidelines:\n1. The target directory already exists (e.g., \"generated-app\"). Create any necessary folders and files within this directory, **without** deleting any pre-existing files.\n   - Example:\n       cd generated-app\n       yes | npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react\n   - **Do not overwrite `.env`** or any other files that the user has provided. .env is CRUCIAL for the development and testing of the application. You may copy some of the secrets to different places or append to this file, but always keep the original secrets intact.\n2. Keep the project **minimal and lightweight**.\n3. Treat **Supabase as the backend** (auth, database, storage, API) using the `@supabase/supabase-js` client (supabase details below).\n4. Organize frontend code in a flat folder structure under `frontend/src/`:\n    - `src/components/` \u2192 reusable UI components\n    - `src/pages/` \u2192 page components\n    - `src/hooks/` \u2192 custom React hooks\n    - `src/lib/` \u2192 helper functions (e.g., Supabase client)\n5. Use **React Router** for navigation if multiple pages are required.\n6. Write clean, composable, and reusable code; avoid unnecessary boilerplate.\n7. Follow Vite + React best practices:\n    - Always use **ES modules** (`import`/`export`)\n    - Lazy-load large components via `React.lazy` or dynamic imports\n    - Do not modify Vite's default config unless necessary\n8. Try to use Tailwind CSS v3. When scaffolding shadcn/ui, use `shadcn@2.3.0` for compatibility.\n\nBackend Services (use only when necessary) for specific API endpoints:\n  Use Express.js with Node.js for API endpoints that can't be handled by Supabase\n  Examples of when a backend service is needed:\n    Most likely: third-party API integrations that require server-side secrets: Stripe, etc.\n    Less likely: complex business logic that requires server-side processing, but only if it is truly necessary.\n\n  Keep REST API simple: use /api/[resource] structure\n  Always validate inputs and handle errors gracefully\n  Refer to the deployment setup for details on how to set it up and include it in the application\n  Remember: most functionality should be handled by Supabase - only create backend services for truly necessary cases\n</TECH_STACK_GUIDELINES>\n\n<UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\nUI/UX Design Guidelines:\n  You must create a modern, professional interface. Make sure your nice design is actually rendered in the application.\n  Follow these principles to create high-quality, professional interfaces:\n\n  Visual Design:\n    - Use consistent design system with unified color tokens, typography, spacing, and components\n    - Limit typography to 4-5 font sizes and weights for visual hierarchy\n    - Stick to 1 neutral base color (e.g., zinc) and up to 2 accent colors maximum\n    - Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm\n\n  Component Architecture:\n    - Build modular, reusable components to avoid duplication\n    - Factor repeated UI patterns into shared components\n    - Keep components small and focused, avoiding unnecessary complexity\n\n  User Experience:\n    - Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling for long content streams\n    - Implement skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` for loading states\n    - Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`)\n    - Provide clear visual feedback for user interactions and state changes\n    - Ensure responsive design that works across different screen sizes\n\nCRITICAL: The design system is everything. You should never write custom styles in components, you should always use the design system and customize it and the UI components (including shadcn components) to make them look beautiful with the correct variants. You never use classes like text-white, bg-white, etc. You always use the design system tokens.\n\n- Maximize reusability of components.\n- Leverage the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files to create a consistent design system that can be reused across the app instead of custom styles everywhere.\n- Create variants in the components you'll use. Shadcn components are made to be customized!\n- You review and customize the shadcn components to make them look beautiful with the correct variants.\n- CRITICAL: USE SEMANTIC TOKENS FOR COLORS, GRADIENTS, FONTS, ETC. It's important you follow best practices. DO NOT use direct colors like text-white, text-black, bg-white, bg-black, etc. Everything must be themed via the design system defined in the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files!\n- Always consider the design system when making changes.\n- Pay attention to contrast, color, and typography.\n- Always generate responsive designs.\n- Beautiful designs are your top priority, so make sure to edit the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files as often as necessary to avoid boring designs and leverage colors and animations.\n- Pay attention to dark vs light mode styles of components. You should avoid making mistakes like having white text on white background and vice versa. You should make sure to use the correct styles for each mode.\n</UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\n\n<SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\nSupabase Integration:\n  You must use Supabase for database, authentication, and storage.\n  The Supabase service is already running and configured. You SHOULD NOT reproduce any of the Supabase services locally.\n  Focus on using the MCP tools and the SDK to interact with the Supabase service as described below. You cannot use the default CLI as if you were accessing Supabase Cloud.\n  The keys and URLs you will need are in the .env file: `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.\n\n  Database:\n    - Use the MCP tools for all database operations (you have access to a self-hosted Supabase database)\n    - The only way to interact with the database is through the MCP tools available to you\n    - Do not create separate database services in Docker\n    - When calling MCP SQL tools, pass statements via the `query` argument (both `execute_sql` and `apply_migration` expect it)\n    - Respect Row Level Security (RLS) and database constraints. Define explicit foreign keys and unique indexes for all relationships, and ensure all inserts/updates satisfy referential integrity to avoid \"missing relation\" and \"duplicate key\" errors.\n    - Capture schema changes as real migrations: prefer the `apply_migration` tool so Supabase records the version, and check the generated SQL into `supabase/migrations/`. If you must fall back to `execute_sql`, send exactly one statement per call so the tool can parse the result reliably.\n    - For admin/seed operations that require bypassing RLS, use the service role key; for user-facing flows, use the anon key and create appropriate RLS policies. Never disable RLS.\n    - Apply schema migrations and policies via the MCP SQL tools before running the app.\n\n  Seeding & Test Data:\n    - Provide a minimal seed routine that creates the records required by the spec and tests (e.g., at least one event and organizer with valid relations).\n    - Make seeding idempotent: upsert by natural keys to avoid duplicate key violations.\n    - Document how to run the seed and run it before UI testing.\n\n  Authentication & Storage:\n    - Use Supabase SDK for authentication and file storage\n    - Use MCP tools for server-side database operations and setup.\n    - The Studio MCP server does not expose auth-user helpers. For seeding or admin automation, call Supabase Auth directly using the service role key\u2014either via `supabase.auth.admin.*` in the SDK or by POSTing to `/auth/v1/admin/users` through Kong. Document any seeded credentials in the README.\n    - Implement proper auth flows (login, signup, logout, protected routes), if it is required by the spec.\n    - Handle authentication state management properly\n    - For the authentication, the email verification is disabled, as well as the third-party authentication like Google, Apple, etc. Do not try to use them.\n    - If there is an authentication flow, strongly test it, as it is the entry point of the application and if it doesn't work, the application won't work.\n    - The anonymous authentication is disabled. Your app should not handle anonymous users and require signed up users.\n    - Use Supabase storage for file uploads when needed\n\n  Additional Services:\n    - You only can use Supabase authentication, database, and storage.\n    - You DO NOT have access to edge functions, neither with MCP nor directly with SDK/CLI.\n    - Any other services you may need must be written in the backend service, only if it is crucial.\n\n  Configuration:\n    - DO NOT hardcode any API keys, secrets, or URLs in the docker-compose.yml file\n    - All sensitive configuration must be in a .env file. The .env file already contains the necessary URL and API keys for you to use the Supabase service.\n    - Reference Supabase documentation if needed: https://supabase.com/docs and https://supabase.com/docs/reference.\n    - Keep in mind the user will not be able to access the Supabase service once you have submitted the app.\n</SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely No Mocks or Stubs (Hard Requirement):\n  - Do not mock payments or return hardcoded success for checkout/subscription flows. A real Stripe test-mode call must occur.\n  - Do not mock email sending; use SMTP with the env values and send test emails (MailHog will capture them in dev).\n  - Avoid in-memory replacements for required services when the spec calls for them (e.g., do not replace Supabase/Stripe with in-memory data for subscriptions or billing flows).\n  - Submissions that include phrases like \"mock Stripe\", \"fake payment\", or bypass external calls will be rejected.\n\n\n<DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n# Deployment Instructions\nDocker and Docker Compose are already installed in the environment. Do not try to install them or change the installed versions.\nThe Docker daemon should also be running in the background. Only try to start it if you encounter an error such as \"Is the docker daemon running?\".\nWhen you start the app, it should be available at the APP_PUBLIC_URL and APP_PUBLIC_PORT, using localhost.\nThe different services (like Supabase) you have access to are using a different host, because they are running in a different place than your development environment. Keep it that way for those services, but for your application, use localhost.\nInside the frontend, you should not hardcode any backend or Supabase URLs you query; instead, you should append them as variables to a .env file.\n\nYou are asked to make the application runnable with Docker Compose.\nIt must be runnable from the generated-app directory, i.e., {workspace_path}/generated-app/ in your case.\nThe project structure should be:\n\n```\n{workspace_path}/\n  .browser_screenshots/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  .downloads/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  generated-app/\n    .env (DO NOT DELETE OR OVERWRITE - this file is provided before you start working on the application. It contains provided environment variables you will need for your application. Do not overwrite it. You may need to copy the values to other .env file).\n    docker-compose.yml\n    frontend/\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.frontend # Dockerfile for the frontend\n      src/ # folder created by the Vite CLI, containing the frontend code\n      ...other folders/files...\n    backend/ # Only create a backend if necessary\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.backend\n    ...other folders/files...\n```\n\nThe backend folder is optional - you only need to create it if necessary.\n\nIf you use CLI tools to initialize the app, never use options that can delete existing files you are provided with, especially the .env file.\nThis .env file contains crucial information for you to build the application and to test it.\n\n## Docker Compose Setup\n- Create a single `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root ({workspace_path}/generated-app/)\n- Name the frontend service exactly `zeeter` (this service will be exposed)\n- Do NOT use `networks` configuration - only fill in the `services` section\n- Do NOT use `container_name` fields\n- Remember that at application test time, there will be no cached Docker images, so you must make sure the build command works.\n- Always run the container by building and then previewing it (e.g. `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`, `npm run serve`, or `npm start`); avoid `npm run dev`.\n- In case you need to save data outside of what Supabase already provides, DO NOT rely on Docker Compose creating persistent volumes for your app's data, because in the testing environment those volumes might not be preserved. Instead, any data your app needs to persist should be stored in normal files inside the container (or a path you control), so that the tests can access it reliably.\n- Keep the docker-compose.yml and the Dockerfiles minimal, as simple as possible.\n- This doesn't need to be production-ready; it just needs to run in development/preview mode. A simple Dockerfile is enough\u2014no need for a multi-stage or optimized production setup.\n- DO NOT use the network_mode field in the docker-compose.yml file.\n\n## Port Configuration\n- The app landing page URL is defined by `APP_PUBLIC_URL` in the `.env`; treat it as the source of truth and never assume `http://localhost:4173`.\n- Always map the host port from `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` to the frontend preview port `4173` in Docker Compose (for example, `ports: - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"`).\n- Do not override `APP_PUBLIC_URL` or `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` inside your code; surface them through environment variables so both frontend and backend use the same public origin.\n- Always import the port from the .env file, never hardcode it in the application code anywhere.\n- Configure Vite to listen on all interfaces for both dev and preview (set `server.host`/`preview.host` to `0.0.0.0` or pass `--host 0.0.0.0`).\n- If you add backend services that are internal-only, prefer `expose: - 8000` instead of publishing them to the host.\n\n## Example of minimal docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile (they might need to be more complex depending on the project). These match all the requirements described above. You might need them to be more complicated depending on the project (especially if you need backend services), but always strive to keep it simple:\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\nEXPOSE 4173\nCMD [\"npm\", \"run\", \"preview\"]\n```\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  donation_manager:\n    build:\n      context: ./frontend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend\n    ports:\n      - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"  # APP_PUBLIC_PORT should always be imported from the .env file\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n\n  backend: # Only use a backend service if necessary\n    build:\n      context: ./backend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n    expose: # NEVER use ports: - 8000:8000 kind of configuration here, as it would publish the backend port outside of the Docker Compose network\n      - 8000\n```\n\nExample of a minimal backend Dockerfile (if necessary):\n```\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\n# Copy only what the backend needs, not the entire frontend\nEXPOSE 8000\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n```\n\n## Docker Ignore\nAlways include a `.dockerignore` file in any relevant folder (e.g. frontend/, backend/, etc.) to avoid copying unnecessary files into the container image.\nAt minimum, ignore build outputs and dependency folders such as: node_modules, dist, build, etc.\nExample of a `.dockerignore` file:\n```\nnode_modules\n.next\ndist\n.git\n```\n\n## Development & Testing Workflow\n1. **Initial build (and try before submitting)**: `docker compose -p zeeter up -d --build`\n2. **After code changes**: `docker compose -p zeeter restart <service>`\n3. **Only rebuild when**: dependencies or docker-compose.yml change\n4. **Check the logs to make sure the application is running correctly**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter logs --tail 200` (or wrap `logs -f` in a short `timeout`) so the command exits on its own.\n5. **Test the app through the UI**: You must browse the running application and take screenshots (you MUST save them in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`) to verify functionality\n6. **Before submitting**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter down -v`\n7. **Report**: Report how the testing went in your final thoughts before submitting your work. Mention what worked or didn't work ,and if you were using the expected workflow. Report precisely the errors or issues you have encountered in the deployment, if any.\n\n## Mandatory Testing\n- Browse the running application and take screenshots to verify functionality\n- Fix issues and restart services until you've verified everything works\n- Save all screenshots in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`\n\nThe application must be fully functional when run with the following command from {workspace_path}/generated-app/:\n```bash\ndocker compose -p zeeter up -d --build\n```\n</DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n\n<README_INSTRUCTIONS>\nREADME instructions:\n  You must create two READMEs for the application:\n  First, a technical TECHNICAL_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. General Implementation\n      - App overview and key features\n      - Tech stack summary\n      - Architecture approach\n  2. Code Structure\n      - Frontend/backend directory layout\n      - Key files and their purposes\n      - Database schema\n\n  Second, a user-friendly USER_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. Navigation Guide to Test the Application\n      - Authentication (admin or not) method if any\n      - Key URLs and actions\n      - If there is an authentication flow, provide default credentials to be able to test the application without recreating an account.\n\n  Note: Exclude startup instructions - app runs via Docker commands in deployment docs\n</README_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n<GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\nGeneral Instructions and Advice:\n  - The folder you are working in is `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace`. You cannot write outside of this folder. It also may contain the following files and folders, that you CANNOT delete in any circumstance (it would break the application):\n  ```\n  /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/\n    .browser_screenshots/\n    .downloads/\n    generated-app/\n  ```\n  - You must create your application in `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/generated-app/` directory. This is where your docker-compose.yml, .env file, and all application code should be placed.\n  - The .browser_screenshots/ and .downloads/ folders at the `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace` level must NEVER be deleted or moved - they are used for testing purposes.\n  - If you have trouble loading data in the application, make sure to `docker compose -p zeeter down -v` before running `docker compose -p zeeter up -d` again. It will clear the volumes and start fresh.\n  - Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for all operations.\n  - Strictly restrict yourself to the services you have access to. Do not try to implement services that are not available to you. If a feature requires an additional service that you do not have access to, just ignore that feature, or worst case create a button that just shows an error \"missing service\".\n  - If you encounter issues with the infrastructure you are running in, make sure to put them in your final thoughts before submitting your work. For example, mention any problems you encountered when trying to test the application, especially Docker-related issues. Make sure to report the commands that failed with the error message.\n  - You must focus on doing the full task. Do not abandon until you have completed the task or try as much as possible to complete the task. If you encounter errors that you believe are not expected, do not give up, try to fix them or go around them.\n  - You are on your own, you CANNOT interact with the user at any point. Do not expect them to take any actions after the code is written. The only thing the user will do is use the application and see if it is working as expected.\n  - Before running any UI tests, run the project's seed routine to ensure required data exists and relationships are valid (avoid RLS and constraint errors during evaluation).\n</GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\n\n<TASK_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\nSpecification for the application.

Make sure your nice design is actually rendered in the application.\n  Follow these principles to create high-quality, professional interfaces:\n\n  Visual Design:\n    - Use consistent design system with unified color tokens, typography, spacing, and components\n    - Limit typography to 4-5 font sizes and weights for visual hierarchy\n    - Stick to 1 neutral base color (e.g., zinc) and up to 2 accent colors maximum\n    - Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm\n\n  Component Architecture:\n    - Build modular, reusable components to avoid duplication\n    - Factor repeated UI patterns into shared components\n    - Keep components small and focused, avoiding unnecessary complexity\n\n  User Experience:\n    - Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling for long content streams\n    - Implement skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` for loading states\n    - Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`)\n    - Provide clear visual feedback for user interactions and state changes\n    - Ensure responsive design that works across different screen sizes\n\nCRITICAL: The design system is everything. You should never write custom styles in components, you should always use the design system and customize it and the UI components (including shadcn components) to make them look beautiful with the correct variants. You never use classes like text-white, bg-white, etc. You always use the design system tokens.\n\n- Maximize reusability of components.\n- Leverage the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files to create a consistent design system that can be reused across the app instead of custom styles everywhere.\n- Create variants in the components you'll use. Shadcn components are made to be customized!\n- You review and customize the shadcn components to make them look beautiful with the correct variants.\n- CRITICAL: USE SEMANTIC TOKENS FOR COLORS, GRADIENTS, FONTS, ETC. It's important you follow best practices. DO NOT use direct colors like text-white, text-black, bg-white, bg-black, etc. Everything must be themed via the design system defined in the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files!\n- Always consider the design system when making changes.\n- Pay attention to contrast, color, and typography.\n- Always generate responsive designs.\n- Beautiful designs are your top priority, so make sure to edit the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files as often as necessary to avoid boring designs and leverage colors and animations.\n- Pay attention to dark vs light mode styles of components. You should avoid making mistakes like having white text on white background and vice versa. You should make sure to use the correct styles for each mode.\n</UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\n\n<SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\nSupabase Integration:\n  You must use Supabase for database, authentication, and storage.\n  The Supabase service is already running and configured. You SHOULD NOT reproduce any of the Supabase services locally.\n  Focus on using the MCP tools and the SDK to interact with the Supabase service as described below. You cannot use the default CLI as if you were accessing Supabase Cloud.\n  The keys and URLs you will need are in the .env file: `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.\n\n  Database:\n    - Use the MCP tools for all database operations (you have access to a self-hosted Supabase database)\n    - The only way to interact with the database is through the MCP tools available to you\n    - Do not create separate database services in Docker\n    - When calling MCP SQL tools, pass statements via the `query` argument (both `execute_sql` and `apply_migration` expect it)\n    - Respect Row Level Security (RLS) and database constraints. Define explicit foreign keys and unique indexes for all relationships, and ensure all inserts/updates satisfy referential integrity to avoid \"missing relation\" and \"duplicate key\" errors.\n    - Capture schema changes as real migrations: prefer the `apply_migration` tool so Supabase records the version, and check the generated SQL into `supabase/migrations/`. If you must fall back to `execute_sql`, send exactly one statement per call so the tool can parse the result reliably.\n    - For admin/seed operations that require bypassing RLS, use the service role key; for user-facing flows, use the anon key and create appropriate RLS policies. Never disable RLS.\n    - Apply schema migrations and policies via the MCP SQL tools before running the app.\n\n  Seeding & Test Data:\n    - Provide a minimal seed routine that creates the records required by the spec and tests (e.g., at least one event and organizer with valid relations).\n    - Make seeding idempotent: upsert by natural keys to avoid duplicate key violations.\n    - Document how to run the seed and run it before UI testing.\n\n  Authentication & Storage:\n    - Use Supabase SDK for authentication and file storage\n    - Use MCP tools for server-side database operations and setup.\n    - The Studio MCP server does not expose auth-user helpers. For seeding or admin automation, call Supabase Auth directly using the service role key\u2014either via `supabase.auth.admin.*` in the SDK or by POSTing to `/auth/v1/admin/users` through Kong. Document any seeded credentials in the README.\n    - Implement proper auth flows (login, signup, logout, protected routes), if it is required by the spec.\n    - Handle authentication state management properly\n    - For the authentication, the email verification is disabled, as well as the third-party authentication like Google, Apple, etc. Do not try to use them.\n    - If there is an authentication flow, strongly test it, as it is the entry point of the application and if it doesn't work, the application won't work.\n    - The anonymous authentication is disabled. Your app should not handle anonymous users and require signed up users.\n    - Use Supabase storage for file uploads when needed\n\n  Additional Services:\n    - You only can use Supabase authentication, database, and storage.\n    - You DO NOT have access to edge functions, neither with MCP nor directly with SDK/CLI.\n    - Any other services you may need must be written in the backend service, only if it is crucial.\n\n  Configuration:\n    - DO NOT hardcode any API keys, secrets, or URLs in the docker-compose.yml file\n    - All sensitive configuration must be in a .env file. The .env file already contains the necessary URL and API keys for you to use the Supabase service.\n    - Reference Supabase documentation if needed: https://supabase.com/docs and https://supabase.com/docs/reference.\n    - Keep in mind the user will not be able to access the Supabase service once you have submitted the app.\n</SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely No Mocks or Stubs (Hard Requirement):\n  - Do not mock payments or return hardcoded success for checkout/subscription flows. A real Stripe test-mode call must occur.\n  - Do not mock email sending; use SMTP with the env values and send test emails (MailHog will capture them in dev).\n  - Avoid in-memory replacements for required services when the spec calls for them (e.g., do not replace Supabase/Stripe with in-memory data for subscriptions or billing flows).\n  - Submissions that include phrases like \"mock Stripe\", \"fake payment\", or bypass external calls will be rejected.\n\n\n<DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n# Deployment Instructions\nDocker and Docker Compose are already installed in the environment. Do not try to install them or change the installed versions.\nThe Docker daemon should also be running in the background. Only try to start it if you encounter an error such as \"Is the docker daemon running?\".\nWhen you start the app, it should be available at the APP_PUBLIC_URL and APP_PUBLIC_PORT, using localhost.\nThe different services (like Supabase) you have access to are using a different host, because they are running in a different place than your development environment. Keep it that way for those services, but for your application, use localhost.\nInside the frontend, you should not hardcode any backend or Supabase URLs you query; instead, you should append them as variables to a .env file.\n\nYou are asked to make the application runnable with Docker Compose.\nIt must be runnable from the generated-app directory, i.e., {workspace_path}/generated-app/ in your case.\nThe project structure should be:\n\n```\n{workspace_path}/\n  .browser_screenshots/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  .downloads/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  generated-app/\n    .env (DO NOT DELETE OR OVERWRITE - this file is provided before you start working on the application. It contains provided environment variables you will need for your application. Do not overwrite it. You may need to copy the values to other .env file).\n    docker-compose.yml\n    frontend/\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.frontend # Dockerfile for the frontend\n      src/ # folder created by the Vite CLI, containing the frontend code\n      ...other folders/files...\n    backend/ # Only create a backend if necessary\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.backend\n    ...other folders/files...\n```\n\nThe backend folder is optional - you only need to create it if necessary.\n\nIf you use CLI tools to initialize the app, never use options that can delete existing files you are provided with, especially the .env file.\nThis .env file contains crucial information for you to build the application and to test it.\n\n## Docker Compose Setup\n- Create a single `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root ({workspace_path}/generated-app/)\n- Name the frontend service exactly `zeeter` (this service will be exposed)\n- Do NOT use `networks` configuration - only fill in the `services` section\n- Do NOT use `container_name` fields\n- Remember that at application test time, there will be no cached Docker images, so you must make sure the build command works.\n- Always run the container by building and then previewing it (e.g. `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`, `npm run serve`, or `npm start`); avoid `npm run dev`.\n- In case you need to save data outside of what Supabase already provides, DO NOT rely on Docker Compose creating persistent volumes for your app's data, because in the testing environment those volumes might not be preserved. Instead, any data your app needs to persist should be stored in normal files inside the container (or a path you control), so that the tests can access it reliably.\n- Keep the docker-compose.yml and the Dockerfiles minimal, as simple as possible.\n- This doesn't need to be production-ready; it just needs to run in development/preview mode. A simple Dockerfile is enough\u2014no need for a multi-stage or optimized production setup.\n- DO NOT use the network_mode field in the docker-compose.yml file.\n\n## Port Configuration\n- The app landing page URL is defined by `APP_PUBLIC_URL` in the `.env`; treat it as the source of truth and never assume `http://localhost:4173`.\n- Always map the host port from `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` to the frontend preview port `4173` in Docker Compose (for example, `ports: - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"`).\n- Do not override `APP_PUBLIC_URL` or `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` inside your code; surface them through environment variables so both frontend and backend use the same public origin.\n- Always import the port from the .env file, never hardcode it in the application code anywhere.\n- Configure Vite to listen on all interfaces for both dev and preview (set `server.host`/`preview.host` to `0.0.0.0` or pass `--host 0.0.0.0`).\n- If you add backend services that are internal-only, prefer `expose: - 8000` instead of publishing them to the host.\n\n## Example of minimal docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile (they might need to be more complex depending on the project). These match all the requirements described above. You might need them to be more complicated depending on the project (especially if you need backend services), but always strive to keep it simple:\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\nEXPOSE 4173\nCMD [\"npm\", \"run\", \"preview\"]\n```\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  donation_manager:\n    build:\n      context: ./frontend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend\n    ports:\n      - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"  # APP_PUBLIC_PORT should always be imported from the .env file\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n\n  backend: # Only use a backend service if necessary\n    build:\n      context: ./backend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n    expose: # NEVER use ports: - 8000:8000 kind of configuration here, as it would publish the backend port outside of the Docker Compose network\n      - 8000\n```\n\nExample of a minimal backend Dockerfile (if necessary):\n```\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\n# Copy only what the backend needs, not the entire frontend\nEXPOSE 8000\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n```\n\n## Docker Ignore\nAlways include a `.dockerignore` file in any relevant folder (e.g. frontend/, backend/, etc.) to avoid copying unnecessary files into the container image.\nAt minimum, ignore build outputs and dependency folders such as: node_modules, dist, build, etc.\nExample of a `.dockerignore` file:\n```\nnode_modules\n.next\ndist\n.git\n```\n\n## Development & Testing Workflow\n1. **Initial build (and try before submitting)**: `docker compose -p zeeter up -d --build`\n2. **After code changes**: `docker compose -p zeeter restart <service>`\n3. **Only rebuild when**: dependencies or docker-compose.yml change\n4. **Check the logs to make sure the application is running correctly**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter logs --tail 200` (or wrap `logs -f` in a short `timeout`) so the command exits on its own.\n5. **Test the app through the UI**: You must browse the running application and take screenshots (you MUST save them in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`) to verify functionality\n6. **Before submitting**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter down -v`\n7. **Report**: Report how the testing went in your final thoughts before submitting your work. Mention what worked or didn't work ,and if you were using the expected workflow. Report precisely the errors or issues you have encountered in the deployment, if any.\n\n## Mandatory Testing\n- Browse the running application and take screenshots to verify functionality\n- Fix issues and restart services until you've verified everything works\n- Save all screenshots in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`\n\nThe application must be fully functional when run with the following command from {workspace_path}/generated-app/:\n```bash\ndocker compose -p zeeter up -d --build\n```\n</DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n\n<README_INSTRUCTIONS>\nREADME instructions:\n  You must create two READMEs for the application:\n  First, a technical TECHNICAL_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. General Implementation\n      - App overview and key features\n      - Tech stack summary\n      - Architecture approach\n  2. Code Structure\n      - Frontend/backend directory layout\n      - Key files and their purposes\n      - Database schema\n\n  Second, a user-friendly USER_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. Navigation Guide to Test the Application\n      - Authentication (admin or not) method if any\n      - Key URLs and actions\n      - If there is an authentication flow, provide default credentials to be able to test the application without recreating an account.\n\n  Note: Exclude startup instructions - app runs via Docker commands in deployment docs\n</README_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n<GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\nGeneral Instructions and Advice:\n  - The folder you are working in is `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace`. You cannot write outside of this folder. It also may contain the following files and folders, that you CANNOT delete in any circumstance (it would break the application):\n  ```\n  /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/\n    .browser_screenshots/\n    .downloads/\n    generated-app/\n  ```\n  - You must create your application in `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/generated-app/` directory. This is where your docker-compose.yml, .env file, and all application code should be placed.\n  - The .browser_screenshots/ and .downloads/ folders at the `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace` level must NEVER be deleted or moved - they are used for testing purposes.\n  - If you have trouble loading data in the application, make sure to `docker compose -p zeeter down -v` before running `docker compose -p zeeter up -d` again. It will clear the volumes and start fresh.\n  - Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for all operations.\n  - Strictly restrict yourself to the services you have access to. Do not try to implement services that are not available to you. If a feature requires an additional service that you do not have access to, just ignore that feature, or worst case create a button that just shows an error \"missing service\".\n  - If you encounter issues with the infrastructure you are running in, make sure to put them in your final thoughts before submitting your work. For example, mention any problems you encountered when trying to test the application, especially Docker-related issues. Make sure to report the commands that failed with the error message.\n  - You must focus on doing the full task. Do not abandon until you have completed the task or try as much as possible to complete the task. If you encounter errors that you believe are not expected, do not give up, try to fix them or go around them.\n  - You are on your own, you CANNOT interact with the user at any point. Do not expect them to take any actions after the code is written. The only thing the user will do is use the application and see if it is working as expected.\n  - Before running any UI tests, run the project's seed routine to ensure required data exists and relationships are valid (avoid RLS and constraint errors during evaluation).\n</GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\n\n<TASK_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\nSpecification for the application.

Your task is to build the application.\nIt is crucial your code works and follows the specification and deployment instructions given below. Focus hard when writing the code.\nYou CANNOT interact with the user at any point, you are on your own. Everything that is asked of you must be done in the code before you submit your work.\nYou CANNOT expect the user to perform any actions during or after the code is written.\nDO NOT stop working until you have a fully working application that you have tested.\nIT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU MAKE SURE TO TEST THE APPLICATION BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR WORK, INCLUDING MAKING SURE YOU BUILD AND START THE DOCKER COMPOSE APPLICATION. DO NOT SUBMIT APPLICATIONS THAT DO NOT RUN. ALWAYS ASSUME ANY ERRORS IN BUILDING OR TESTING THE APPLICATION ARE YOUR FAULT AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX.\n\n<TECH_STACK_GUIDELINES>\nTech stack guidelines:\nAlways use **React with Vite** as the framework for the frontend.\nDo not use Next.js or any other framework unless explicitly requested.\n\nProject scaffold guidelines:\n1. The target directory already exists (e.g., \"generated-app\"). Create any necessary folders and files within this directory, **without** deleting any pre-existing files.\n   - Example:\n       cd generated-app\n       yes | npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react\n   - **Do not overwrite `.env`** or any other files that the user has provided. .env is CRUCIAL for the development and testing of the application. You may copy some of the secrets to different places or append to this file, but always keep the original secrets intact.\n2. Keep the project **minimal and lightweight**.\n3. Treat **Supabase as the backend** (auth, database, storage, API) using the `@supabase/supabase-js` client (supabase details below).\n4. Organize frontend code in a flat folder structure under `frontend/src/`:\n    - `src/components/` \u2192 reusable UI components\n    - `src/pages/` \u2192 page components\n    - `src/hooks/` \u2192 custom React hooks\n    - `src/lib/` \u2192 helper functions (e.g., Supabase client)\n5. Use **React Router** for navigation if multiple pages are required.\n6. Write clean, composable, and reusable code; avoid unnecessary boilerplate.\n7. Follow Vite + React best practices:\n    - Always use **ES modules** (`import`/`export`)\n    - Lazy-load large components via `React.lazy` or dynamic imports\n    - Do not modify Vite's default config unless necessary\n8. Try to use Tailwind CSS v3. When scaffolding shadcn/ui, use `shadcn@2.3.0` for compatibility.\n\nBackend Services (use only when necessary) for specific API endpoints:\n  Use Express.js with Node.js for API endpoints that can't be handled by Supabase\n  Examples of when a backend service is needed:\n    Most likely: third-party API integrations that require server-side secrets: Stripe, etc.\n    Less likely: complex business logic that requires server-side processing, but only if it is truly necessary.\n\n  Keep REST API simple: use /api/[resource] structure\n  Always validate inputs and handle errors gracefully\n  Refer to the deployment setup for details on how to set it up and include it in the application\n  Remember: most functionality should be handled by Supabase - only create backend services for truly necessary cases\n</TECH_STACK_GUIDELINES>\n\n<UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\nUI/UX Design Guidelines:\n  You must create a modern, professional interface. Make sure your nice design is actually rendered in the application.\n  Follow these principles to create high-quality, professional interfaces:\n\n  Visual Design:\n    - Use consistent design system with unified color tokens, typography, spacing, and components\n    - Limit typography to 4-5 font sizes and weights for visual hierarchy\n    - Stick to 1 neutral base color (e.g., zinc) and up to 2 accent colors maximum\n    - Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm\n\n  Component Architecture:\n    - Build modular, reusable components to avoid duplication\n    - Factor repeated UI patterns into shared components\n    - Keep components small and focused, avoiding unnecessary complexity\n\n  User Experience:\n    - Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling for long content streams\n    - Implement skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` for loading states\n    - Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`)\n    - Provide clear visual feedback for user interactions and state changes\n    - Ensure responsive design that works across different screen sizes\n\nCRITICAL: The design system is everything. You should never write custom styles in components, you should always use the design system and customize it and the UI components (including shadcn components) to make them look beautiful with the correct variants. You never use classes like text-white, bg-white, etc. You always use the design system tokens.\n\n- Maximize reusability of components.\n- Leverage the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files to create a consistent design system that can be reused across the app instead of custom styles everywhere.\n- Create variants in the components you'll use. Shadcn components are made to be customized!\n- You review and customize the shadcn components to make them look beautiful with the correct variants.\n- CRITICAL: USE SEMANTIC TOKENS FOR COLORS, GRADIENTS, FONTS, ETC. It's important you follow best practices. DO NOT use direct colors like text-white, text-black, bg-white, bg-black, etc. Everything must be themed via the design system defined in the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files!\n- Always consider the design system when making changes.\n- Pay attention to contrast, color, and typography.\n- Always generate responsive designs.\n- Beautiful designs are your top priority, so make sure to edit the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files as often as necessary to avoid boring designs and leverage colors and animations.\n- Pay attention to dark vs light mode styles of components. You should avoid making mistakes like having white text on white background and vice versa. You should make sure to use the correct styles for each mode.\n</UI_UX_DESIGN_GUIDELINES>\n\n<SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\nSupabase Integration:\n  You must use Supabase for database, authentication, and storage.\n  The Supabase service is already running and configured. You SHOULD NOT reproduce any of the Supabase services locally.\n  Focus on using the MCP tools and the SDK to interact with the Supabase service as described below. You cannot use the default CLI as if you were accessing Supabase Cloud.\n  The keys and URLs you will need are in the .env file: `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.\n\n  Database:\n    - Use the MCP tools for all database operations (you have access to a self-hosted Supabase database)\n    - The only way to interact with the database is through the MCP tools available to you\n    - Do not create separate database services in Docker\n    - When calling MCP SQL tools, pass statements via the `query` argument (both `execute_sql` and `apply_migration` expect it)\n    - Respect Row Level Security (RLS) and database constraints. Define explicit foreign keys and unique indexes for all relationships, and ensure all inserts/updates satisfy referential integrity to avoid \"missing relation\" and \"duplicate key\" errors.\n    - Capture schema changes as real migrations: prefer the `apply_migration` tool so Supabase records the version, and check the generated SQL into `supabase/migrations/`. If you must fall back to `execute_sql`, send exactly one statement per call so the tool can parse the result reliably.\n    - For admin/seed operations that require bypassing RLS, use the service role key; for user-facing flows, use the anon key and create appropriate RLS policies. Never disable RLS.\n    - Apply schema migrations and policies via the MCP SQL tools before running the app.\n\n  Seeding & Test Data:\n    - Provide a minimal seed routine that creates the records required by the spec and tests (e.g., at least one event and organizer with valid relations).\n    - Make seeding idempotent: upsert by natural keys to avoid duplicate key violations.\n    - Document how to run the seed and run it before UI testing.\n\n  Authentication & Storage:\n    - Use Supabase SDK for authentication and file storage\n    - Use MCP tools for server-side database operations and setup.\n    - The Studio MCP server does not expose auth-user helpers. For seeding or admin automation, call Supabase Auth directly using the service role key\u2014either via `supabase.auth.admin.*` in the SDK or by POSTing to `/auth/v1/admin/users` through Kong. Document any seeded credentials in the README.\n    - Implement proper auth flows (login, signup, logout, protected routes), if it is required by the spec.\n    - Handle authentication state management properly\n    - For the authentication, the email verification is disabled, as well as the third-party authentication like Google, Apple, etc. Do not try to use them.\n    - If there is an authentication flow, strongly test it, as it is the entry point of the application and if it doesn't work, the application won't work.\n    - The anonymous authentication is disabled. Your app should not handle anonymous users and require signed up users.\n    - Use Supabase storage for file uploads when needed\n\n  Additional Services:\n    - You only can use Supabase authentication, database, and storage.\n    - You DO NOT have access to edge functions, neither with MCP nor directly with SDK/CLI.\n    - Any other services you may need must be written in the backend service, only if it is crucial.\n\n  Configuration:\n    - DO NOT hardcode any API keys, secrets, or URLs in the docker-compose.yml file\n    - All sensitive configuration must be in a .env file. The .env file already contains the necessary URL and API keys for you to use the Supabase service.\n    - Reference Supabase documentation if needed: https://supabase.com/docs and https://supabase.com/docs/reference.\n    - Keep in mind the user will not be able to access the Supabase service once you have submitted the app.\n</SUPABASE_INTEGRATION>\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely No Mocks or Stubs (Hard Requirement):\n  - Do not mock payments or return hardcoded success for checkout/subscription flows. A real Stripe test-mode call must occur.\n  - Do not mock email sending; use SMTP with the env values and send test emails (MailHog will capture them in dev).\n  - Avoid in-memory replacements for required services when the spec calls for them (e.g., do not replace Supabase/Stripe with in-memory data for subscriptions or billing flows).\n  - Submissions that include phrases like \"mock Stripe\", \"fake payment\", or bypass external calls will be rejected.\n\n\n<DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n# Deployment Instructions\nDocker and Docker Compose are already installed in the environment. Do not try to install them or change the installed versions.\nThe Docker daemon should also be running in the background. Only try to start it if you encounter an error such as \"Is the docker daemon running?\".\nWhen you start the app, it should be available at the APP_PUBLIC_URL and APP_PUBLIC_PORT, using localhost.\nThe different services (like Supabase) you have access to are using a different host, because they are running in a different place than your development environment. Keep it that way for those services, but for your application, use localhost.\nInside the frontend, you should not hardcode any backend or Supabase URLs you query; instead, you should append them as variables to a .env file.\n\nYou are asked to make the application runnable with Docker Compose.\nIt must be runnable from the generated-app directory, i.e., {workspace_path}/generated-app/ in your case.\nThe project structure should be:\n\n```\n{workspace_path}/\n  .browser_screenshots/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  .downloads/ (DO NOT DELETE - used for testing)\n  generated-app/\n    .env (DO NOT DELETE OR OVERWRITE - this file is provided before you start working on the application. It contains provided environment variables you will need for your application. Do not overwrite it. You may need to copy the values to other .env file).\n    docker-compose.yml\n    frontend/\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.frontend # Dockerfile for the frontend\n      src/ # folder created by the Vite CLI, containing the frontend code\n      ...other folders/files...\n    backend/ # Only create a backend if necessary\n      .env (if necessary)\n      .dockerignore\n      Dockerfile.backend\n    ...other folders/files...\n```\n\nThe backend folder is optional - you only need to create it if necessary.\n\nIf you use CLI tools to initialize the app, never use options that can delete existing files you are provided with, especially the .env file.\nThis .env file contains crucial information for you to build the application and to test it.\n\n## Docker Compose Setup\n- Create a single `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root ({workspace_path}/generated-app/)\n- Name the frontend service exactly `zeeter` (this service will be exposed)\n- Do NOT use `networks` configuration - only fill in the `services` section\n- Do NOT use `container_name` fields\n- Remember that at application test time, there will be no cached Docker images, so you must make sure the build command works.\n- Always run the container by building and then previewing it (e.g. `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`, `npm run serve`, or `npm start`); avoid `npm run dev`.\n- In case you need to save data outside of what Supabase already provides, DO NOT rely on Docker Compose creating persistent volumes for your app's data, because in the testing environment those volumes might not be preserved. Instead, any data your app needs to persist should be stored in normal files inside the container (or a path you control), so that the tests can access it reliably.\n- Keep the docker-compose.yml and the Dockerfiles minimal, as simple as possible.\n- This doesn't need to be production-ready; it just needs to run in development/preview mode. A simple Dockerfile is enough\u2014no need for a multi-stage or optimized production setup.\n- DO NOT use the network_mode field in the docker-compose.yml file.\n\n## Port Configuration\n- The app landing page URL is defined by `APP_PUBLIC_URL` in the `.env`; treat it as the source of truth and never assume `http://localhost:4173`.\n- Always map the host port from `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` to the frontend preview port `4173` in Docker Compose (for example, `ports: - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"`).\n- Do not override `APP_PUBLIC_URL` or `APP_PUBLIC_PORT` inside your code; surface them through environment variables so both frontend and backend use the same public origin.\n- Always import the port from the .env file, never hardcode it in the application code anywhere.\n- Configure Vite to listen on all interfaces for both dev and preview (set `server.host`/`preview.host` to `0.0.0.0` or pass `--host 0.0.0.0`).\n- If you add backend services that are internal-only, prefer `expose: - 8000` instead of publishing them to the host.\n\n## Example of minimal docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile (they might need to be more complex depending on the project). These match all the requirements described above. You might need them to be more complicated depending on the project (especially if you need backend services), but always strive to keep it simple:\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\nEXPOSE 4173\nCMD [\"npm\", \"run\", \"preview\"]\n```\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  donation_manager:\n    build:\n      context: ./frontend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend\n    ports:\n      - \"${APP_PUBLIC_PORT}:4173\"  # APP_PUBLIC_PORT should always be imported from the .env file\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n\n  backend: # Only use a backend service if necessary\n    build:\n      context: ./backend\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n    expose: # NEVER use ports: - 8000:8000 kind of configuration here, as it would publish the backend port outside of the Docker Compose network\n      - 8000\n```\n\nExample of a minimal backend Dockerfile (if necessary):\n```\nFROM node:22-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\n# Copy only what the backend needs, not the entire frontend\nEXPOSE 8000\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n```\n\n## Docker Ignore\nAlways include a `.dockerignore` file in any relevant folder (e.g. frontend/, backend/, etc.) to avoid copying unnecessary files into the container image.\nAt minimum, ignore build outputs and dependency folders such as: node_modules, dist, build, etc.\nExample of a `.dockerignore` file:\n```\nnode_modules\n.next\ndist\n.git\n```\n\n## Development & Testing Workflow\n1. **Initial build (and try before submitting)**: `docker compose -p zeeter up -d --build`\n2. **After code changes**: `docker compose -p zeeter restart <service>`\n3. **Only rebuild when**: dependencies or docker-compose.yml change\n4. **Check the logs to make sure the application is running correctly**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter logs --tail 200` (or wrap `logs -f` in a short `timeout`) so the command exits on its own.\n5. **Test the app through the UI**: You must browse the running application and take screenshots (you MUST save them in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`) to verify functionality\n6. **Before submitting**: Run `docker compose -p zeeter down -v`\n7. **Report**: Report how the testing went in your final thoughts before submitting your work. Mention what worked or didn't work ,and if you were using the expected workflow. Report precisely the errors or issues you have encountered in the deployment, if any.\n\n## Mandatory Testing\n- Browse the running application and take screenshots to verify functionality\n- Fix issues and restart services until you've verified everything works\n- Save all screenshots in `{workspace_path}/.browser_screenshots/`\n\nThe application must be fully functional when run with the following command from {workspace_path}/generated-app/:\n```bash\ndocker compose -p zeeter up -d --build\n```\n</DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n\n<README_INSTRUCTIONS>\nREADME instructions:\n  You must create two READMEs for the application:\n  First, a technical TECHNICAL_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. General Implementation\n      - App overview and key features\n      - Tech stack summary\n      - Architecture approach\n  2. Code Structure\n      - Frontend/backend directory layout\n      - Key files and their purposes\n      - Database schema\n\n  Second, a user-friendly USER_README.md at project root in /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/generated-app/, at most one page long, with:\n  1. Navigation Guide to Test the Application\n      - Authentication (admin or not) method if any\n      - Key URLs and actions\n      - If there is an authentication flow, provide default credentials to be able to test the application without recreating an account.\n\n  Note: Exclude startup instructions - app runs via Docker commands in deployment docs\n</README_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n<GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\nGeneral Instructions and Advice:\n  - The folder you are working in is `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace`. You cannot write outside of this folder. It also may contain the following files and folders, that you CANNOT delete in any circumstance (it would break the application):\n  ```\n  /app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/\n    .browser_screenshots/\n    .downloads/\n    generated-app/\n  ```\n  - You must create your application in `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace/generated-app/` directory. This is where your docker-compose.yml, .env file, and all application code should be placed.\n  - The .browser_screenshots/ and .downloads/ folders at the `/app/output/v1.1/zeeter/anthropic_claude_sonnet_4_6/openhands_anthropic_claude-sonnet-4-6/zeeter/run_20260226_044630_5831770a/workspace` level must NEVER be deleted or moved - they are used for testing purposes.\n  - If you have trouble loading data in the application, make sure to `docker compose -p zeeter down -v` before running `docker compose -p zeeter up -d` again. It will clear the volumes and start fresh.\n  - Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for all operations.\n  - Strictly restrict yourself to the services you have access to. Do not try to implement services that are not available to you. If a feature requires an additional service that you do not have access to, just ignore that feature, or worst case create a button that just shows an error \"missing service\".\n  - If you encounter issues with the infrastructure you are running in, make sure to put them in your final thoughts before submitting your work. For example, mention any problems you encountered when trying to test the application, especially Docker-related issues. Make sure to report the commands that failed with the error message.\n  - You must focus on doing the full task. Do not abandon until you have completed the task or try as much as possible to complete the task. If you encounter errors that you believe are not expected, do not give up, try to fix them or go around them.\n  - You are on your own, you CANNOT interact with the user at any point. Do not expect them to take any actions after the code is written. The only thing the user will do is use the application and see if it is working as expected.\n  - Before running any UI tests, run the project's seed routine to ensure required data exists and relationships are valid (avoid RLS and constraint errors during evaluation).\n</GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_AND_ADVICE>\n\n<TASK_INSTRUCTIONS>\n\nSpecification for the application.
